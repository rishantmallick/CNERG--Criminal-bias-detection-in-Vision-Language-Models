• Performed Multimodality of Generative Models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and its Fined Tuned Model by developing SHAP Explainer and
implementing the Research Paper ”MM-SHAP: A Performance-agnostic Metric for Measuring Multimodal Contributions in Vision and Language
Models Tasks” and attained a T-SHAP score of 0.667 for the fine tuned QWEN model and 0.669 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
• Developed a RAG model for 4 VLM models - LLavaNext,Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct,Idefics and Intern-VL using chromaDB for Indexing, and
compared accuracy of the bail prediction for 3500 legal case dataset in the RAG model with the accuracy of the bail prediction for 3500 legal
case dataset in case of the vanilla model .
• Performed BERT Score for summaries and case-statement of 3000 datasets to check their similarity
