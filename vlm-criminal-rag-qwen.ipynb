In short, according to the story, the plaintiff's suit states that on the morning of today's 24-03-2021 we went to our farm < name >. We both have farms nearby. I < name > that a motor from my tubewell is not a starter, and a motor from Omkar's tubewell is also not. We searched around a lot, but no one found out. We have stolen the motor starter from unknown persons in the < name > of the date 22/23.03.2021. The meri motor was of 7 1 ⁄ 2 horsepower and the starter was of Rison company and the motor of Omkar was of 7 1 ⁄ 2 horsepower which was of Weston company. So request Mr. During the course of investigation, on the information of the informant, the accused was by the police party and his three co-accused were also and the motor pump parts and the broken starter were recovered from the possession of the accused and his co-accused. The learned counsel for the accused submitted that the applicant has been falsely implicated and falsely implicated in the aforesaid case, he has not committed any such offence, he is innocent. The First Information Report is in the unknown. The applicant undertakes repair work. He has not committed any theft by calling from home on the pretext of repairing. He has not committed any theft. Fake recoveries have been shown. The accused is lodged in the district jail since the date 25-03-2021. He has no criminal antecedents. He will not misuse the bail. No other bail application is pending in any court. Therefore, bail should be granted to the accused. The learned Assistant District Government Advocate opposed the bail application of the accused stating that the accused is accused of stealing the motor of the tube well of the plaintiff suit. The accused has committed a serious offence. Therefore, the bail application of the accused be dismissed.\n",

On behalf of the applicant / accused, it is stated in the affidavit in his application that this is his first bail application and no bail application is pending in the Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad. This fact has not been contradicted by the prosecution. According to Tahir Vadini < name > dated 12.11.2018, the brief story is that at about 10 am on 01.11.2018, she came with her 14-year-old minor daughter Ujala from her house near Ari Mai Mandir and was ready to leave for Maika Itay to tell Govinda's Dharmend alias Kallu and Gulabchandra and Bhagwan < name > Pipra, Vadini and Usildaki that let's get you people to Itay and the above people took Vadini to Thanadostpur Sultanpur elsewhere, and the girl was taken away. They were seated further back. Vadini was imprisoned for eight days. Somehow there was a commotion. Vadini left, the above people ran away. Vadini somehow came home and gave a written about the above incident. A case under Sections 385 / 2018, 363, 366, IPC and 7 / 8 POCSO Act was registered against the accused Dharmendra alias Kallu, Gulab Chand, and Bhagwan Das at the local police station, Madiahe. I have heard in detail the arguments of the learned counsel for the applicant / accused and the learned Assistant District Government Advocate (Criminal) appearing for the State. The learned counsel for the applicant / accused contends that he is innocent and has never been wanted in any other case. The plaintiff is falsely implicated in the suit for being the illegitimate and under the influence of liquor baron Kapildev and for being his girlfriend. The alleged stepmother of the alleged abuser Ujala < name > is the plaintiff < name > of illicit liquor baron Kapildev, who is a person of debauchery. The plaintiff lured the suit < name > long before his daughter Ujala < name > and had illicit relations. The plaintiff, Prashant alias Bhagwan, wife of liquor baron Kapildev, under the influence of illicit liquor baron Kapildev, has not been falsely named as the wife of the plaintiff < name > Ramesh Kapildev. Opposing the bail on behalf of the State, it is submitted that the plaintiff / accused has abused and concealed the minor daughter of the plaintiff, aged about 14 years, with an intention to cause her undue hypnosis and has opposed the plea for cancellation of her bail application. A perusal of the records reveals that the applicant / accused is not named in the FIR. The plaintiff has admissible to support the narrative of the FIR. The applicant is alleged to have coerced the plaintiff's minor daughter, aged about 14 years, with the intention of having sexual intercourse outside the legal guardianship of her parents, and to have concealed and maligned the despite knowing that she was dead.\n",

It was submitted on behalf of the applicants that he is absolutely innocent and has not committed any crime. The of the complainant is absolutely false and far from truth. The reported by the complainant is absolutely fake and false, no such has happened. The said has been filed by the complainant due to old enmity. The given by the complainant has been recorded in Section-2007. In the complaint, the complainant herself has said that the accused entered the house after beating her and called her by her name.
