Defendants specialize in providing a variety of landscape and grounds keeping  services, including some landscaping related construction services, for business and residential  clients.   12.  Defendant Gregory Hamann has operational control over the Defendant Prime  Lawn Care Inc. business by exercising control over the terms and conditions of the business\\u2019s  employees, maintaining business records, and possessing the power to hire and fire Prime Lawn  Care Inc.\\u2019s employees.    13.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Gregory Hamann developed the scheme  to underpay Prime Lawn Care Inc. employees. He established the employees\\u2019 wage rates and  Prime Lawn Care Inc.\\u2019s pay practices.    14.  Defendants employed named Plaintiff as a landscape laborer under the H-2B  temporary visa program in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.  Defendants employed approximately 58  H-2B workers in 2011, 61 in 2012, 61 in 2013, 65 in 2014.    15.  Upon information and belief, Defendants employed approximately 80 hourly  employees engaged in landscaping during each of the relevant years.   16.  Plaintiff was, and Class Members are or were, assigned to work crews of 3-5  workers per crew and are or were responsible for providing a variety of landscaping and grounds  keeping-related services.   18.   Plaintiff was and Class Members are or were paid hourly, at a rate based on their  level of expertise and the type of work performed. For example, employees that worked on the  Defendants\\u2019 landscaping related construction crews were paid at a higher hourly rate than  maintenance crews.       19.  Plaintiff was and Class Members are or were required to arrive at Defendants  shop by 7am to do work prior to beginning their paid shift.  Similarly, Plaintiff was and Class  Members are or were required to do work after their paid shift.    20.  Plaintiff were and Class Members are or were regularly not paid at all for their  work performed prior to leaving the shop in the morning or after arriving to the shop in the  afternoon.    21.  Plaintiff worked and Class Members worked or work routinely more than forty  hours per week and often were or are not paid for all of their overtime hours worked.     22.  When Plaintiff and Class Members were paid for their hours worked in excess of  forty in a workweek, they were often compensated in cash and at their regular hourly rate.    23.  At all times relevant to this action, the Defendants knowingly, willfully, or with  reckless disregard, carried out the illegal pattern or practice of failing to pay overtime wages due  to the Plaintiff and Class Members.   24.  At all times relevant to this action, the Defendants failed to maintain complete and  accurate records of the Plaintiff and Class Members\\u2019 hours of work and compensation as  required by the FLSA.   26.  The Plaintiff have fulfilled all prerequisites and/or requirements to bring this suit  and obtain the relief sought herein.  27.  Defendants employed other individuals (Class Members) to perform the same or  similar job duties as Plaintiff in that they worked performing landscaping or landscaping related  construction duties for the Defendants.   28.   Plaintiff was aware that the Defendants engaged in the same pattern and practice  of failing to properly compensate Class Members for all hours worked and failing to pay the  overtime compensation as required by the FLSA.   29.  Plaintiff and Class Members were and are subjected to the same pay provisions in  that they were not and are not paid for all the hours they worked or work, and were and are  regularly not paid the overtime rate (time-and-one-half regular hourly rate) for the hours they  worked or work in excess of forty hours per week.    30.  Defendants knowingly, willfully, or with reckless disregard carried out their  illegal pattern or practice of failing to pay overtime wages with respect to Plaintiff and Class  Members by failing to pay each employee for his/her total hours worked and/or by failing to pay  each employee at the proper overtime rate for work hours performed over forty hours in a  workweek.     32.  The Defendants\\u2019 failure to pay the overtime compensation at the rates required by  the FLSA results from generally applicable policies or practices and does not depend on the  personal circumstances of the Plaintiff or those joining this lawsuit. Rather, the same policy or  practice which resulted in the non-payment of overtime wages to Plaintiff applied to all Class  Members. Accordingly, the \\u201cClass Members\\u201d are properly defined as:   All workers who were subject to the work hours and payment practices detailed above and  who were consequently not paid properly in accordance with 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7207.   33.  All Class Members, regardless of their precise job requirements or rates of pay,  are entitled to overtime compensation for all hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.  Although the issue of damages may be individual in character, there is no detraction from the  common nucleus of liability facts.  35.  Under 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 216, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover  unpaid overtime compensation, as well as an equal amount as liquidated damages, as well as  attorney fees and costs.   FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT  \",\n          \"20.  NYX\\u2019s Website is heavily integrated with its physical stores, serving as a  gateway to those brick and mortar locations. Through the Website, NYX customers are,  inter alia, able to: find information about the stores\\u2019 locations and hours of operation;  purchase makeup and makeup accessories (e.g., lipstick, lipgloss, bronzer, blush,  eyeliner, brushes) and learn about those products (e.g., learn \\u201cwhat\\u2019s trending,\\u201d best  sellers, \\u201cfan faves\\u201d); purchase a gift card; learn about and access special offers and sales  (e.g., discounts, special mark downs); learn style tips; and learn about the company\\u2019s  refund policies.   21.  It is, upon information and belief, NYX\\u2019s policy and practice to deny  Plaintiff Young and other blind or visually-impaired users access to its Website, thereby  denying the goods and services that are offered and integrated with NYX\\u2019s stores. Due to  NYX\\u2019s failure and refusal to remove access barriers to its Website, Plaintiff Young and  visually-impaired persons have been and are still being denied equal access to NYX\\u2019s  stores and the numerous goods, services, and benefits offered to the public through the  Website.    22.  Plaintiff Young cannot use a computer without the assistance of screen- reading software. He is, however, a proficient JAWS screen-reader user and uses it to  access the Internet. He has visited the Website on separate occasions using the JAWS  screen-reader.    25.  Due to the inaccessibility of its Website, blind and visually-impaired  customers such as Plaintiff Young, who need screen-readers, cannot fully and equally use  or enjoy the facilities, goods, and services NYX offer to the public on its Website. The  Website\\u2019s access barriers that Plaintiff Young encountered have caused a denial of his  full and equal access in the past, and now deter him on a regular basis from accessing the  Website. These access barriers have likewise deterred him from visiting NYX\\u2019s physical  stores and enjoying them equal to sighted individuals.   26.  If the Website was equally accessible to all, Plaintiff Young could  independently navigate it and complete a desired transaction as sighted individuals do.   27.  Through his attempts to use the Website, Plaintiff Young has actual  knowledge of the access barriers that make these services inaccessible and independently  unusable by blind and visually-impaired people.   29.  NYX therefore uses standards, criteria or methods of administration that  have the effect of discriminating or perpetuating the discrimination of others, as alleged  herein.   30.  Title III of the ADA expressly contemplates the injunctive relief that  Plaintiff seeks:  In the case of violations of . . . this title, injunctive relief shall include an  order to alter facilities to make such facilities readily accessible to and  usable by individuals with disabilities . . . Where appropriate, injunctive  relief shall also include requiring the . . . modification of a policy . . .  42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12188(a)(2).   32.  Although NYX may currently have centralized policies regarding  maintaining and operating its Website, NYX lacks a plan and policy reasonably  calculated to make them fully and equally accessible to, and independently usable by,  blind and other visually impaired consumers.   33.  Without injunctive relief, Plaintiff Young and other visually impaired  consumers will continue to be unable to independently use the Website, violating its  rights.   34.  NYX has, upon information and belief, invested substantial sums in  developing and maintaining its Website and has generated significant revenue from the  Website. These amounts are far greater than the associated cost of making its Website  equally accessible to visually impaired customers.   36.  Plaintiff Young seeks to certify a nationwide class under Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind individuals in the United States who have attempted  to access NYX\\u2019s Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal enjoyment  of goods and services offered in NYX\\u2019s physical locations, during the relevant statutory  period (\\u201cClass Members\\u201d).   37.  Plaintiff Young seeks to certify a State of New York subclass under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind individuals in the State of New York who  have attempted to access the Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal  enjoyment of goods and services offered in NYX\\u2019s physical locations, during the relevant  statutory period (\\u201cNew York Subclass Members\\u201d).   38.  Plaintiff Young seeks to certify a New York City subclass under Fed. R.  Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind individuals in the City of New York who have  attempted to access the Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal  enjoyment of goods and services offered in NYX\\u2019s physical locations, during the relevant  statutory period (\\u201cNew York City Subclass Members\\u201d).   40.  Plaintiff\\u2019s claims are typical of the Class Members, New York Subclass  Members and New York City Subclass Members: they are all severely visually impaired  or otherwise blind, and claim that NYX has violated Title III of the ADA, NYSHRL or  NYCHRL by failing to update or remove access barriers on its Website so it can be  independently accessible to the visually impaired individuals.   41.  Plaintiff Young will fairly and adequately represent and protect the Class  and Subclasses\\u2019 interests because he has retained and is represented by counsel  competent and experienced in complex class action litigation, and because he has no  interests antagonistic to the Class or Subclasses. Class certification of the claims is  appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because NYX has acted or refused to act on  grounds generally applicable to the Class and Subclasses, making appropriate both  declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiff, the Class and Subclasses.   43.  Judicial economy will be served by maintaining this lawsuit as a class  action in that it is likely to avoid the burden that would be otherwise placed upon the  judicial system by the filing of numerous similar suits by people with visual disabilities  throughout the United States.  44.   Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf of the Class Members, repeats  and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   45.  Title III of the ADA prohibits \\u201cdiscriminat[ion] on the basis of disability  in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,  or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,  leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\\u201d 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12182(a).   46.  NYX\\u2019s stores are public accommodations within the definition of Title III  of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12181(7). Its Website is a service, privilege, or advantage of  NYX\\u2019s stores. The Website is a service that is integrated with these locations.   47.  Under Title III of the ADA, it is unlawful discrimination to deny  individuals with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods,  services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of an entity. 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7  12182(b)(1)(A)(i).   49.  Under Title III of the ADA, unlawful discrimination also includes, among  other things:  [A] failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or  procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods,  services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to  individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making  such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods,  services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations; and a  failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual  with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise  treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of  auxiliary aids and services, unless the entity can demonstrate that taking  such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the good, service,  facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation being offered or would  result in an undue burden.  42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).   50.  These acts alleged herein violate Title III of the ADA, and the regulations  promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff Young, who is a member of a protected class of  persons under Title III of the ADA, has a physical disability that substantially limits the  major life activity of sight within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 12102(1)(A)-(2)(A).  Furthermore, he has been denied full and equal access to the Website, has not been  provided services that are provided to other patrons who are not disabled, and has been  provided services that are inferior to the services provided to non-disabled persons.    51.  Under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12188 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set  forth and incorporated therein, Plaintiff Young requests the relief as set forth below.  53.  N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7 296(2)(a) provides that it is \\u201can unlawful discriminatory  practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent,  agent or employee of any place of public accommodation . . . because of the . . . disability  of any person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person any  of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof.\\u201d   54.  NYX\\u2019s physical locations are in the State of New York and throughout the  United States and constitute sales establishments and public accommodations within the  definition of N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7 292(9). NYX\\u2019s Website is a service, privilege or  advantage of NYX. NYX\\u2019s Website is a service that is by and integrated with these  physical locations.   55.  NYX is subject to NYSHRL because it owns and operates its physical  locations and the Website. NYX is a \\u201cperson\\u201d within the meaning of N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7  292(1).   56.  NYX is violating N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7 296(2)(a) in refusing to update or  remove access barriers to its Website, causing its Website and the services integrated  with its physical locations to be completely inaccessible to the blind. This inaccessibility  denies blind patrons full and equal access to the facilities, goods and services that NYX  makes available to the non-disabled public.   58.  Under N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7 296(2)(c)(ii), unlawful discriminatory practice  also includes, \\u201ca refusal to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no  individual with a disability is excluded or denied services because of the absence of  auxiliary aids and services, unless such person can demonstrate that taking such steps  would fundamentally alter the nature of the facility, privilege, advantage or  accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden.\\u201d    59.  Readily available, well-established guidelines exist on the Internet for  making websites accessible to the blind and visually impaired. These guidelines have  been followed by other large business entities and government agencies in making their  websites accessible, including but not limited to: adding alt-text to graphics and ensuring  that all functions can be performed using a keyboard. Incorporating the basic components  to make its Website accessible would neither fundamentally alter the nature of its  business nor result in an undue burden to them.   61.  NYX discriminates, and will continue in the future to discriminate against  Plaintiff Young and New York Subclass Members on the basis of disability in the full  and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,  accommodations and/or opportunities of NYX\\u2019s Website and its physical locations under  \\u00a7 296(2) et seq. and/or its implementing regulations. Unless the Court enjoins NYX from  continuing to engage in these unlawful practices, Plaintiff and the New York Subclass  Members will continue to suffer irreparable harm.   62.  As NYX\\u2019s actions violate the NYSHRL, Plaintiff Young seeks injunctive  relief to remedy the discrimination.   63.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to compensatory damages, as well as civil  penalties and fines under N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7 297(4)(c) et seq. for every offense.   64.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to reasonable attorneys\\u2019 fees and costs.   65.  Under N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7 297 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set  forth and incorporated therein Plaintiff prays for judgment as set forth below.  66.  Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf the New York Subclass  Members, repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully  set forth herein.   68.  N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \\u00a7 40 provides that \\u201call persons within the  jurisdiction of this state shall be entitled to the full and equal accommodations,  advantages, facilities and privileges of any places of public accommodations, resort or  amusement, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and  applicable alike to all persons. No persons, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager,  superintendent, agent, or employee of any such place shall directly or indirectly refuse,  withhold from, or deny to any person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities  and privileges thereof . . .\\u201d   69.  N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \\u00a7 40-c(2) provides that \\u201cno person because of . . .   disability, as such term is defined in section two hundred ninety-two of executive law, be  subjected to any discrimination in his or her civil rights, or to any harassment, as defined  in section 240.25 of the penal law, in the exercise thereof, by any other person or by any  firm, corporation or institution, or by the state or any agency or subdivision.\\u201d   70.  NYX\\u2019s New York City physical locations are sales establishments and  public accommodations within the definition of N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \\u00a7 40-c(2). NYX\\u2019s  Website is a service, privilege or advantage of NYX and its Website is a service that is by  and integrated with these establishments.   71.  NYX is subject to N.Y. Civ. Rights Law because it owns and operates its  physical locations and Website. NYX is a person within the meaning of N.Y. Civil Law \\u00a7  40-c(2).   73.  N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \\u00a7 41 states that \\u201cany corporation which shall violate  any of the provisions of sections forty, forty-a, forty-b or forty two . . . shall for each and  every violation thereof be liable to a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor  more than five hundred dollars, to be recovered by the person aggrieved thereby . . .\\u201d   74.  Under N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \\u00a7 40-d, \\u201cany person who shall violate any of  the provisions of the foregoing section, or subdivision three of section 240.30 or section  240.31 of the penal law, or who shall aid or incite the violation of any of said provisions  shall for each and every violation thereof be liable to a penalty of not less than one  hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, to be recovered by the person  aggrieved thereby in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the  Defendants shall reside . . .\\u201d   75.  NYX discriminates, and will continue to discriminate against Plaintiff  Young and the New York Subclass Members on the basis of disability, as they are being  directly or indirectly refused, withheld from, or denied the accommodations, advantages,  facilities and privileges thereof in \\u00a7 40 et seq. and/or its implementing regulations.   77.  Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf the New York City Subclass  Members, repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully  set forth herein.   78.  The NYCHRL provides that \\u201cIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory  practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent,  agent or employee of any place or provider of public accommodation, because of . . .  disability . . . directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person, any  of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof.\\u201d N.Y.C. Admin.  Code \\u00a7 8-107(4)(a).   79.  NYX\\u2019s locations are sales establishments and public accommodations  within the meaning of the NYCHRL, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \\u00a7 8-102(9), and its Website is  a service that is integrated with its establishments.   80.  NYX is subject to NYCHRL because it owns and operates its physical  locations in the City of New York and its Website, making it a person within the meaning  of N.Y.C. Admin. Code \\u00a7 8-102(1).   81.  NYX is violating the NYCHRL in refusing to update or remove access  barriers to Website, causing its Website and the services integrated with its physical  locations to be completely inaccessible to the blind. This inaccessibility denies blind  patrons full and equal access to the facilities, goods, and services that NYX make  available to the non-disabled public.   83.  NYX\\u2019s actions constitute willful intentional discrimination against the  Subclass because of a disability, violating the NYCHRL, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \\u00a7 8- 107(4)(a) and \\u00a7 8-107(15)(a,) in that it has:  a.  Constructed and maintained a website that is inaccessible to blind  class members with knowledge of the discrimination; and/or  b.  Constructed and maintained a website that is sufficiently intuitive  and/or obvious that is inaccessible to blind class members; and/or  c.  Failed to take actions to correct these access barriers in the face of  substantial harm and discrimination to blind class members.   84.  As such, NYX discriminates, and will continue in the future to  discriminate against Plaintiff and the New York City Subclass Members because of  disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,  advantages, accommodations and/or opportunities of its Website and its establishments  under \\u00a7 8-107(4)(a) and/or its implementing regulations. Unless the Court enjoins NYX  from continuing to engage in these unlawful practices, Plaintiff and the New York City  Subclass will continue to suffer irreparable harm.   86.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to compensatory damages, as well as civil  penalties and fines for each offense. N.Y.C. Admin. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 8-120(8), 8-126(a).   87.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to reasonable attorneys\\u2019 fees and costs.   88.  Under N.Y.C. Admin. Code \\u00a7 8-120 and \\u00a7 8-126 and the remedies,  procedures, and rights set forth and incorporated therein Plaintiff prays for judgment as  set forth below.  89.  Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf the Class Members, repeats  and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   90.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the parties in that  Plaintiff Young contends, and is informed and believes that NYX denies, that its Website  contains access barriers denying blind customers the full and equal access to the goods,  services and facilities of its Website and by extension its physical locations, which NYX  owns, operates and controls, fails to comply with applicable laws including, but not  limited to, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 12182, et seq.,  N.Y. Exec. Law \\u00a7 296, et seq., and N.Y.C. Admin. Code \\u00a7 8-107, et seq. prohibiting  discrimination against the blind.   91.  A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate now in order that each  of the parties may know its respective rights and duties and act accordingly.  DECLARATORY RELIEF   NYX\\u2019s Website And Its Barriers   VIOLATIONS OF THE ADA, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12181 et seq.   VIOLATIONS OF THE NYCHRL   VIOLATIONS OF THE NYSHRL   VIOLATIONS OF THE NEW YORK STATES CIVIL RIGHTS LAW  \",\n          \"37.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their behalf and as a class action pursuant to Rules  23(a) & (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of all persons or entities who  purchased any \\u201cinvestment\\u201d offered by Defendants from May 6, 2006 until the present day (the  \\u201cClass Period\\u201d) and who suffered damages as a result (the \\u201cClass\\u201d).   38.  Excluded from the Class are: a. Defendants; b. members of the immediate family  of each of the Defendants that are not corporate entities; c. any person who was an executive  officer, employee and/or director of any Defendant during the Class Period; d. any person, firm,  trust, corporation, officer, director or any other individual or entity in which any Defendant has a  controlling interest or which is affiliated with any of the Defendants; e. any independent  contractor of any Defendants who participated in the sales of the investment  vehicles outlined  herein; and f. the legal representatives, agents, affiliates, heirs, successors-in-interest or assigns  of any such excluded party.   40.  Plaintiffs\\u201f claims are typical of the claims of members of the Class. Plaintiffs and  all members of the Class sustained damages as a result of the Defendants\\u201f unlawful course of  conduct including racketeering, money laundering, fraud, negligence, conversion, breach of  fiduciary duty, and fraud and other malfeasance as specified herein.   41.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the members of the  Class and has retained counsel competent and experienced in class action litigation. Plaintiffs  have no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the members of the Class that  Plaintiffs seek to represent.   42.   A class action is superior to other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication  of this controversy. The damages suffered by individual Class members may be relatively small,  some as little as $5,000; therefore the expense and burden of individual litigation make it  virtually impossible for the Class members individually to seek redress for the wrongful conduct  alleged herein.   44.   Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of  this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action.   45.   The names and addresses of the Defendants\\u201f customers and investors who  purchased \\u201cinvestments\\u201d  during the Class Period are obtainable from information in the  possession of the Defendants and/or their agents. Notice can be provided to such owners via first  class mail or email using techniques and a form of notice similar to those customarily used in  class actions.  46.  TAYLOR has always claimed to come from humble beginnings and bragged that  he started working at 12 and became a millionaire at the ripe old age of 16.  Then he \\u201cretired\\u201d  with his \\u201cvast fortune\\u201d but became \\u201cbored\\u201d and came back to work in 2000.   47.   Beginning in 2000,TAYLOR started touting himself to the public as a \\u201cself-made  millionaire at 16\\u201d by claiming that in 1998 he launched a company with a high school partner  called GoFerretGo.com that became a multi-million dollar company.     49.   TAYLOR repeatedly claimed in books, newspapers, television interviews,  emails, radio ads and You Tube videos that GoFerretGo.com had a value of $3.5 million at some  point during its less than 3 year history.   However, GoFerretGo.com mysteriously dissolved in  2001.   50.  TAYLOR tirelessly told the GoFerretGo.com story to potential investors, news  and TV reporters, church members, politicians, community leaders, etc. over many years in order  to garner their trust and gain access to other potential investors, who would be introduced to  TAYLOR through trusted members of their community, i.e., church leaders and pastors,  politicians, philanthropic leaders, etc.   51.  In 2004, Defendant TAYLOR formed Christian Capital Group, LLC (\\u201cChristian  Capital\\u201d), a Missouri limited liability company.  Defendant TAYLOR was the \\u201cexecutive  trustee\\u201d of Christian Capital. Throughout his meteoric rise to fame, TAYLOR always went back  to his roots, scamming mainly African-American and minority persons of faith with his  investment schemes.   52.  TAYLOR targeted minority and African American persons of faith because he  knew that there was an unwritten (and sometimes written) tenet imposed upon church members,  particularly in African-American and Christian churches, which can best be described as \\u201cwhat  happens in church stays in church.\\u201d The tenets of many Christian religions require disputes  among church members to be handled by the church through its Elders, Deacons and Minister  (assuming the Minister is not involved).     54.  TAYLOR was a master at using verbal constructions to describe the investment  \\u201copportunities\\u201d he was hawking so that they sounded extremely impressive but actually were  meaningless. TAYLOR used his confidence trick to take advantage of his targets\\u201f lack of  investment knowledge. TAYLOR served as a \\u201chub\\u201d for the victims recruiting and interacting  with them directly in order to perpetuate the scheme.   55.  The Ponzi schemes orchestrated by the CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS were  particularly well planned because the \\u201cinvestments\\u201d of the Plaintiffs and other Class members  were set up to automatically renew or \\u201crollover\\u201d each year such that the investors could not  liquidate their investments automatically at the end of the investment period and, in fact, were  not even notified at the end of any investment period that they could withdraw their investment  funds or\\u201d choose\\u201d to reinvest; the interest that purportedly was being earned on the investment  \\u201cappeared\\u201d in the investors/victims\\u201f self-directed IRA accounts at EQUITY TRUST  automatically and regardless of whether the accrued interest had actually been placed in the  account.  (It had not for the majority of investors/victims).     56.  The CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS kept sending out investment account  statements and providing information to investors/victims showing the CITY CAPITAL  investors/victims the extraordinary investment returns they were earning by keeping their money  in their EQUITY TRUST self-directed IRA account thus maintaining the deception that the  schemes of the CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS were providing high returns.    58.  Investors conned by the CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS would reinvest their  money in these schemes because they appeared to pay a much better return than any alternative  investment opportunity. At least the returns appeared much better according to their EQUITY  TRUST account statements.   59.   According to a press release issued by a Missouri entity called \\u201dChristian  Capital\\u201d and TAYLOR, Christian Capital was a non-profit ministry \\u201cthat employs biblical  principles to help individuals increase their financial resources through low-risk investment  opportunities.\\u201d (Ex. A). TAYLOR frequently reminded his targets that these were \\u201conce in a  lifetime\\u201d opportunities and that the potential investor needed to move fast or lose their place in  line for this investment \\u201copportunity.\\u201d    60.   TAYLOR in 2004 made investment presentations for the \\u201cProsperity Fund\\u201d a/k/a  Prosperity Ministries run by Christian Capital at minority and African-American churches in  Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.  (Ex. A).     61.  Taylor at times referred to himself as a \\u201cMinister\\u201d and an \\u201cordained Minister.\\u201d   62.  Upon information and belief, TAYLOR never had any formal seminary training  nor had he ever been the minister or leader of a church.    64.   Defendant TAYLOR advertised that participation through investment in the  Prosperity Fund would help participants, many of whom were church-goers who heard  TAYLOR speak at their church, learn about how to: \\u201celiminate consumer debt without  consolidation or refinancing; retire in 10 years or less; and be a part of a low-risk investment  with high performances\\u201d which were also \\u201cbeneficial to the financial success of the church and  community.\\u201d (Ex. B).     65.  TAYLOR told the potential Prosperity Fund investors that God had helped him  find the perfect investment opportunity for the church and its members. This investment scam by  TAYLOR was a prelude to the Socially Conscious Investment Ponzi Scam of which Plaintiffs  and other Class members are victims, as discussed below.   66.  In September of 2004, TAYLOR was sued for fraud in the case of Williford et al  v. Ephren Taylor, Jr. (\\u201cWilliford Complaint\\u201d) in Missouri both personally and as trustee of the  Prosperity Ministries trust.  Also named as defendants in the suit were his wife, Meshelle Taylor,  his father, (also named Ephren Taylor) and his father\\u201fs church, Johnson County Church of Christ  (\\u201cJohnson County Church\\u201d).  (Ex. C).    67.  After this set back, rather than give up on his scams, TAYLOR decided to go  bigger.   69.   TAYLOR started holding himself out to the public in books, newspapers,  television, emails, radio ads and videos as a successful businessman overseeing $250 million  dollars in assets of two publicly traded companies.   70.  An essential part of TAYLOR\\u201fS scam, as with other Ponzi schemes, was and is to  make investors want to invest in him via his wildly successful \\u201ccompanies.\\u201d  While some of  TAYLOR\\u201fS investment success \\u201cstories\\u201d and personal financial dealings may have been real, the  majority of them were purely fabricated.    71.  Upon information and belief, Defendants BRANTLEY, WEB3 and MCCARTHY  were instrumental in helping TAYLOR create the fictional character that TAYLOR assumed and  which permitted him to bilk millions of dollars from hundreds or thousands of investors.   72.  Through numerous press releases and hundreds of speaking engagements, books,  blogs, You Tube videos, radio and television commercials and interviews and public  appearances, TAYLOR convinced the world that he was a \\u201cMinister,\\u201d financial guru, investment  wizard, multi- million dollar business manager and philanthropic rock star.   73.   A Ponzi scheme or fraudulent enterprise cannot be successful or even operate  without the help of a number of individuals both inside and outside the company perpetuating the  scheme.  The facts will show that TAYLOR was part of a carefully orchestrated con-not a solo  act.     A.  THE CREATION OF EPHREN TAYLOR'S IMAGE    CONSPIRACY  (against all Defendants)  502.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege herein paragraphs 1-503 above as  if fully set forth herein.  503.  At all relevant times, all Defendants joined in a common effort to commit the  tortuous conduct and violations of state and federal law alleged in this complaint.  504.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege herein paragraphs 1-450 above as  if fully set forth herein.  452.   Further, as part of Defendants\\u201f operation of the Socially Conscious Investment  Ponzi Scam and the Sweeps Machine Investment Ponzi Scam, they engaged in, and otherwise  caused, numerous financial transactions and transfers through financial institutions in the United  States, which transactions violated 18 U.S.C. Sections 1956 and 1957.  453.  Defendants committed acts of money laundering, namely financial transactions, to  promote their unlawful misappropriation of investor funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1956  (a) (1) (A) and to conceal their unlawful activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1956 (a) (1)  VIOLATION OF NORTH CAROLINA SECURITIES ACT  Chapter 78A-10  (Against all Defendants)   542. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege herein paragraphs 1-541 above as  if fully set forth herein.  543.  The acts and practices of the Defendants alleged herein violated Chapter 78A-10  of the North Carolina Securities Act, in that Defendants made, or caused to be made,  representations or statements which were false, where (i) they knew the truth, or (ii) with  reasonable efforts could have known the truth, or (iii) made no reasonable effort to ascertain the  truth, or (iv) did not have knowledge concerning the representations or statements made, where  said representations or statements were engaged in to induce or promote the issuance,  distribution, exchange, sale, negotiation, or purchase within or from this state of securities.  VIOLATION OF NORTH CAROLINA SECURITIES ACT Chapter 78A-11  (Against all  Defendants)  546.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege paragraphs 1 through 545 above as if fully incorporated  herein.    547.  The acts and practices of the Defendants alleged herein violated Chapter 78A-11 of  the North Carolina Securities Act, in that they involved the use or employment of a fraud, deception,  concealment, suppression, or false pretense, where said uses or employments were engaged in to  induce or promote the issuance, distribution, exchange, sale, negotiation, or purchase within or from  this state of securities by the use of unlawful telephone rooms in violation of Chapter 78A-11. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"verdict\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"lose\",\n          \"win\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summaries\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Defendants specialize in providing landscape and grounds keeping services, including construction services, for business and residential clients.

      "10.  Defendants specialize in providing a variety of landscape and grounds keeping  services, including some landscaping related construction services, for business and residential  clients.   12.  Defendant Gregory Hamann has operational control over the Defendant Prime  Lawn Care Inc. business by exercising control over the terms and conditions of the business’s  employees, maintaining business records, and possessing the power to hire and fire Prime Lawn  Care Inc.’s employees.    13.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Gregory Hamann developed the scheme  to underpay Prime Lawn Care Inc. employees. He established the employees’ wage rates and  Prime Lawn Care Inc.’s pay practices.    14.  Defendants employed named Plaintiff as a landscape laborer under the H-2B  temporary visa program in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.  Defendants employed approximately 58  H-2B workers in 2011, 61 in 2012, 61 in 2013, 65 in 2014.    15.  Upon information and belief, Defendants employed approximately 80 hourly  employees engaged in landscaping during each of the relevant years.   16.  Plaintiff was, and Class Members are or were, assigned to work crews of 3-5  workers per crew and are or were responsible for providing a variety of landscaping and grounds  keeping-related services.   18.   Plaintiff was and Class Members are or were paid hourly, at a rate based on their  level of expertise and the type of work performed. For example, employees that worked on the  Defendants’ landscaping related construction crews were paid at a higher hourly rate than  maintenance crews.       19.  Plaintiff was and Class Members are or were required to arrive at Defendants  shop by 7am to do work prior to beginning their paid shift.  Similarly, Plaintiff was and Class  Members are or were required to do work after their paid shift.    20.  Plaintiff were and Class Members are or were regularly not paid at all for their  work performed prior to leaving the shop in the morning or after arriving to the shop in the  afternoon.    21.  Plaintiff worked and Class Members worked or work routinely more than forty  hours per week and often were or are not paid for all of their overtime hours worked.     22.  When Plaintiff and Class Members were paid for their hours worked in excess of  forty in a workweek, they were often compensated in cash and at their regular hourly rate.    23.  At all times relevant to this action, the Defendants knowingly, willfully, or with  reckless disregard, carried out the illegal pattern or practice of failing to pay overtime wages due  to the Plaintiff and Class Members.   24.  At all times relevant to this action, the Defendants failed to maintain complete and  accurate records of the Plaintiff and Class Members’ hours of work and compensation as  required by the FLSA.   26.  The Plaintiff have fulfilled all prerequisites and/or requirements to bring this suit  and obtain the relief sought herein.  27.  Defendants employed other individuals (Class Members) to perform the same or  similar job duties as Plaintiff in that they worked performing landscaping or landscaping related  construction duties for the Defendants.   28.   Plaintiff was aware that the Defendants engaged in the same pattern and practice  of failing to properly compensate Class Members for all hours worked and failing to pay the  overtime compensation as required by the FLSA.   29.  Plaintiff and Class Members were and are subjected to the same pay provisions in  that they were not and are not paid for all the hours they worked or work, and were and are  regularly not paid the overtime rate (time-and-one-half regular hourly rate) for the hours they  worked or work in excess of forty hours per week.    30.  Defendants knowingly, willfully, or with reckless disregard carried out their  illegal pattern or practice of failing to pay overtime wages with respect to Plaintiff and Class  Members by failing to pay each employee for his/her total hours worked and/or by failing to pay  each employee at the proper overtime rate for work hours performed over forty hours in a  workweek.     32.  The Defendants’ failure to pay the overtime compensation at the rates required by  the FLSA results from generally applicable policies or practices and does not depend on the  personal circumstances of the Plaintiff or those joining this lawsuit. Rather, the same policy or  practice which resulted in the non-payment of overtime wages to Plaintiff applied to all Class  Members. Accordingly, the “Class Members” are properly defined as:   All workers who were subject to the work hours and payment practices detailed above and  who were consequently not paid properly in accordance with 29 U.S.C. §207.   33.  All Class Members, regardless of their precise job requirements or rates of pay,  are entitled to overtime compensation for all hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.  Although the issue of damages may be individual in character, there is no detraction from the  common nucleus of liability facts.  35.  Under 29 U.S.C. § 216, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover  unpaid overtime compensation, as well as an equal amount as liquidated damages, as well as  attorney fees and costs.

      "(Class Action Claim for Violation of the AMWA)   (Collective Action Claim for Violations of the FLSA)   (Individual Claim for Violation of the AMWA)   (Individual Claim for FLSA Overtime Violations)   25.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   26.  Plaintiff worked for Defendants in the maintenance/housekeeping and  janitor/maintenance hourly-paid positions that are standard in Defendants' 650 retail travel  centers and travel plazas.   27.  Plaintiff worked at Defendants' location 7801 Alcoa Rd., Benton, AR 72019.   28.  Throughout Plaintiff's employment, Defendants classified Plaintiff and other  hourly-paid employees as non-exempt and paid Plaintiff an hourly rate.   29.  It was Defendants' commonly applied practice to pay Plaintiff and other hourly- paid employees for fewer than all of the hours than the number of hours they actually performed  labor for Defendants.   30.  Specifically, Plaintiff and other hourly-paid employees were required to work and  subject to Defendants' policy or practice of regularly making deductions for purported meal breaks  despite Plaintiff and the others similarly situated employees not actually taking bona fide meal  breaks; and also Plaintiff and the other similarly situated employees had to perform off the clock  work for Defendants while not clocked-in.   32.  Defendants  required  Plaintiff  and  other  hourly-paid  maintenance/housekeeping/janitor workers to continue working during their regularly scheduled  lunch shift breaks.   33.  Further, Plaintiff and other hourly-paid maintenance/housekeeping/janitor  workers had to continue working up to thirty (30) minutes or more after their regularly scheduled  shifts ended.   34.  Defendants did not permit Plaintiff and other hourly-paid workers to stay clocked- in after the scheduled end time of their shifts.   35.  At times, Defendant's manager(s) edited time sheets to reflect Plaintiff and other  similarly situated employees, took lunch breaks when, in fact, they had not, and to alter Plaintiff's  end times to the financial advantage of Defendants.   36.  As a result of these policies, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and other hourly-paid  employees a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and a proper overtime premium for all of  the hours Plaintiff, etc., worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a week.   37.  At all relevant times herein, Defendants failed to accurately record all of the time  worked off-the-clock by Plaintiff and other hourly-paid workers and failed to properly compensate  all of the off-the-clock hours.   39.  At all times relevant hereto, Defendants was aware of the minimum wage and  overtime requirements of the FLSA.  V.  40.  Plaintiff brings his claims for relief for violation of the FLSA as a collective action  pursuant to Section 16(b) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).   41.  The FLSA Collective consists of all persons who were, are, or will be employed by  Defendants as hourly-paid maintenance/janitor /housekeeping workers at any time within the  applicable statute of limitations period.   42.  The relevant time period dates back three years from the date on which Plaintiff'  Class and Collective Action Complaint was filed herein and continues forward through the date of  judgment pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 255(a).   43.  The members of the proposed Hourly FLSA Collective are similarly situated in that  they share these traits:  a.  They were classified by Defendants as non-exempt from the minimum wage and  overtime requirements of the FLSA;  b.  They were paid hourly rates; and  c.  They were subject to Defendants' common policy of requiring employees to work  time for which they were not compensated.   45.  Defendants can readily identify the members of the Section 16(b) Collective, which  encompasses all hourly-paid plant workers within the past three years.   46.  The names and physical and mailing addresses of the FLSA collective action  Plaintiff are available from Defendants, and a Court-approved Notice should be provided to the  FLSA collective action Plaintiffs via first class mail and email to their last known physical and  electronic mailing addresses as soon as possible, together with other documents and information  descriptive of Plaintiff's FLSA claim.  B.  AMWA Rule 23 Classes   47.  Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated who were  employed by Defendants within the State of Arkansas, bring this claim for relief for violation of the  AM.WA as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   48.  Plaintiff proposes to represent all persons who were, are, or will be employed by  Defendants as similarly situated hourly-paid maintenance/janitor/housekeeping workers within  Arkansas at any time within the applicable statute of limitations period.   49.  Upon information and belief, Defendants employ or have employed within the  statutory period more than forty ( 40) hourly employees within Arkansas. Therefore, the proposed  Hourly AMW A Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.   60.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if  fully set forth in this section.   62.  During the relevant time period, Defendants unlawfully refrained from paying  Plaintiff a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and an overtime premium for hours over  forty per week.   63.  Defendants' failure to pay Plaintiff all overtime wages owed was willful.   64.  By reason of the unlawful acts alleged herein, Defendants are liable to Plaintiff for  monetary damages, liquidated damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, for all  violations that occurred within the three (3) years prior to the filing of this Complaint.  65.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   66.  Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, asserts this claim  for damages and declaratory relief pursuant to the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. § 201, et seq.   67.  At all relevant times, Defendants have and continue to be an \"employer\" of  Plaintiff and all those similarly situated within the meaning of the FLSA, 29 U .S.C. § 203.   68.  Defendants classified Plaintiff and all similarly situated members of the Hourly  FLSA Collective as non-exempt from the overtime requirements of the FLSA.   69.  Despite the entitlement of Plaintiff and those similarly situated to minimum wage  and overtime payments under the FLSA, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and all those similarly  situated a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and an overtime rate of one and one-half  times their regular rates of pay for all hours worked over forty ( 40) in each one-week period.   71.  Like Plaintiff, these hourly-paid cleaning workers regularly worked more than forty  (40) hours in a week.   72.  Because these employees are similarly situated to Plaintiff, and are owed unpaid  wages and overtime for the same reasons, the opt-in class may be properly defined as:  All hourly-paid employees in the housekeeping/janitor and housekeeping/  maintenance positions within the past three years.   73.  Defendants willfully failed to pay overtime wages to Plaintiff and to others similarly  situated.   74.  By reason of the unlawful acts alleged herein, Defendants are liable to Plaintiff and  all those similarly situated for monetary damages, liquidated damages, and costs, including  reasonable attorneys' fees, for all violations that occurred within the three (3) years prior to the  filing of this Complaint.  75.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   76.  Plaintiff asserts this claim for damages and declaratory relief pursuant to the  AM.WA, Arkansas Code Annotated §§ 11-4-201, et seq.   77.  At all relevant times, Defendants were Plaintiff's \"employer\" within the meaning  of the AM.WA, Ark. Code Ann.§ 11-4-203(4).   79.  Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and  an overtime premium for hours over forty per week, as required under the AMW A.   80.  Defendants' failure to pay Plaintiff a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and  an overtime rate of pay for hours worked over forty ( 40) in a given week was in violation of the  84.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   86.  At all relevant times, Defendants have been, and continues to be, an \"employer\"  of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed class within the meaning of the AMW A, Arkansas  Code Annotated§ 11-4-203(4).   87.  Defendants classified Plaintiff and all members of the AMW A Class as non-exempt  from the overtime requirements of the AMW A.   88.  Despite the entitlement of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed class to  minimum wage and overtime payments under the AMW A, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and  the members of the proposed class for all hours worked, including an overtime rate of one and one- half times their regular rates of pay for all hours worked over forty ( 40) in each one-week period.   89.  Plaintiff proposes to represent the AM.WA liability class of individuals defined as  follows:  All hourly-paid employees in the housekeeping/janitor and housekeeping/ maintenance  positions in Arkansas within the past three years.   90.  Defendants willfully failed to pay a lawful minimum wage and overtime wages to  Plaintiff and the members of the proposed class.   A.  FLSA § 216(b) Class  \n",

      "17.  As part of its business practices, Defendant would uniformly send text messages to  hundreds, if not thousands, of consumers.  Upon information and belief, Defendant has sent at least ten  thousand illegal text messages over the last four years preceding this lawsuit.   18.  Plaintiff herself was sent at least two text messages without his express consent.   19.  Below is a depiction of actual text messages received by Plaintiff from Defendant:   21.  At no point in time did Plaintiff provide Defendant with his express consent to be  contacted.   22.  Plaintiff is the subscriber and sole user of the ***-***-9685 phone number.   23.  The impersonal and generic nature of Defendant’s text messages, and the use of a short- code, demonstrates that Defendant utilized an ATDS in transmitting the messages. See Jenkins v. LL  Atlanta, LLC, No. 1:14- cv-2791-WSD, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30051, at *11 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 9,  2016) (“These assertions, combined with the generic, impersonal nature of the text message  advertisements and the use of a short code, support an inference that the text messages were sent using  an ATDS.”) (citing Legg v. Voice Media Grp., Inc., 20 F. Supp. 3d 1370, 1354 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (plaintiff  alleged facts sufficient to infer text messages were sent using ATDS; use of a short code and volume of  mass messaging alleged would be impractical without use of an ATDS); Kramer v. Autobytel, Inc., 759  F. Supp. 2d 1165, 1171 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (finding it “plausible” that defendants used an ATDS where  messages were advertisements written in an impersonal manner and sent from short code); Robbins v.  Coca-Cola Co., No. 13-CV-132- IEG NLS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72725, 2013 WL 2252646, at *3  (S.D. Cal. May 22, 2013) (observing that mass messaging would be impracticable without use of an  26.  Plaintiff brings this case as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, on behalf of  herself and all others similarly situated.   27.  Plaintiff brings this case on behalf of a Class defined as follows:  All persons within the United States who, within the four years  prior to the filing of this Complaint, received text message made  through the use of any automatic telephone dialing system, from  Defendant or anyone on Defendant’s behalf, to said person’s  cellular telephone number, not for emergency purpose and  without the recipient’s prior express consent.   28.  Defendant and their employees or agents, Plaintiff’s attorneys and their employees, the  Judge to whom this action is assigned and any member of the Judge’s staff and immediate family, and  claims for personal injury, wrongful death, and/or emotional distress are excluded from the Class.  Plaintiff does not know the number of members in the Class, but believes the Class members number  in the several thousands, if not more.  31.  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to the Class which predominate  over any questions affecting only individual members of the Class. Among the questions of law and  fact common to the Class are:  (1) Whether Defendant made non-emergency calls to Plaintiff’s and Class  members’ cellular telephones using an ATDS;  (2) Whether Defendant can meet their burden of showing that they obtained prior  express consent to make such calls;  (3) Whether Defendant conduct was knowing and willful;  (4) Whether Defendant are liable for damages, and the amount of such damages;  and  (5) Whether Defendant should be enjoined from such conduct in the future.   32.  The common questions in this case are capable of having common answers. If Plaintiff’s  claim that Defendant routinely transmits text messages to telephone numbers assigned to cellular  telephone services is accurate, Plaintiffs and the Class members will have identical claims capable of  being efficiently adjudicated and administered in this case.  37.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-36 as if fully set forth herein.   38.  It is a violation of the TCPA to make “any call (other than a call made for  emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party) using any  automatic telephone dialing system . . .  to any telephone number assigned to a … cellular telephone  service ….” 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii).   40.  Defendant – or third parties directed by Defendant– used equipment having the  capacity to dial numbers without human intervention to make telephone calls to the cellular  telephones of Plaintiff and the other members of the Class defined above.   41.  These calls were made without regard to whether Defendant had first obtained  express consent to make such calls. In fact, Defendant did not have prior express consent to call  the cell phones of Plaintiff and Class Members when the subject calls were made.   42.  Defendant therefore, violated § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the TCPA by using an  automatic telephone dialing system to make telephone calls to the cell phones of Plaintiff and Class  Members without their prior express consent.   43.  All possible Defendants are directly, jointly, or vicariously liable for each such  violation of the TCPA.   44.  As a result of Defendant’s conduct and pursuant to § 227(b)(3) of the TCPA,  Plaintiff and the other members of the putative Class were harmed and are each entitled to a  minimum of $500.00 in damages for each violation. Plaintiff and the class are also entitled to an  injunction against future calls.  45.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-36 as if fully set forth herein.    47.  Defendant knew that they did not have prior express consent to send these text  messages.   48.  Because Defendant knew or should have known that Plaintiff and Class Members  had not given prior express consent to receive its autodialed calls to their cellular telephones, the  Court should treble the amount of statutory damages available to Plaintiff and the other members  of the putative Class pursuant to § 227(b)(3) of the TCPA.   49.  All possible Defendants are directly, jointly, or vicariously liable for each such  violation of the TCPA.   50.  As a result of Defendant violations, Plaintiff and the Class Members are entitled to  an award of $1,500.00 in statutory damages, for each and every violation, pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  § 227(b)(3)(B) and 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3)(C).  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, AMY BETIT, on behalf of herself and the other members of  the Class, prays for the following relief:  a.  A declaration that Defendant practices described herein violate the Telephone  Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227;  b.  A declaration that Defendant violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act,  47 U.S.C. § 227, were willful and knowing;  c.  An injunction prohibiting Defendant from using an automatic telephone dialing  system to call and text message telephone numbers assigned to cellular telephones without the  prior express consent of the called party;  d.  An award of actual, statutory damages, and/or trebled statutory damages; and  e.  Such further and other relief the Court deems reasonable and just.

      "27.  Defendant offers the commercial website, https://www.jonnyseeds.com/, to  the public. The website offers features which should allow all consumers to access the  goods and services offered by the Defendant and which Defendant ensures delivery of such  goods throughout the United States including New York State. The goods and services  offered by Defendant’s website include, but are not limited to, purchasing a wide selection  of plant seeds, and to ascertain information relating to pricing, shipping, ordering  merchandise and return and privacy policies.   28.  It is, upon information and belief, Defendant’s policy and practice to deny  Plaintiff, along with other blind or visually-impaired users, access to Defendant’s website,  and to therefore specifically deny the goods and services that are offered thereby. Due to  Defendant’s failure and refusal to remove access barriers to its website, Plaintiff and  visually-impaired persons have been and are still being denied equal access to Defendant’s  numerous goods, services and benefits offered to the public through the Website.   29.  Plaintiff is a visually-impaired and legally blind person, who cannot use a  computer without the assistance of screen-reading software. Plaintiff is, however, a  proficient JAWS screen-reader user and uses it to access the Internet. Plaintiff has visited  the Website on separate occasions using the JAWS screen-reader.   30.  During Plaintiff’s visits to the Website, the last occurring in April, 2021, in  an attempt to purchase a product from the Defendant, the Plaintiff encountered multiple  access barriers that denied Plaintiff a shopping experience similar to that of a sighted  person and full and equal access to the goods and services offered to the public and made  -11-  available to the public; and that denied Plaintiff the full enjoyment of the goods, and  services of the Website by being unable to purchase seeds and to ascertain information  relating to pricing, shipping, ordering merchandise and return and privacy policies.   31.  While attempting to navigate the Website, Plaintiff encountered multiple  accessibility barriers for blind or visually-impaired persons that include, but are not limited  to, the following:  a.  Lack of Alternative Text (“alt-text”), or a text equivalent. Alt-text is  an invisible code embedded beneath a graphical image on a website. Web accessibility  requires that alt-text be coded with each picture so that screen-reading software can speak  the alt-text where a sighted user sees pictures, which includes captcha prompts. Alt-text  does not change the visual presentation, but instead a text box shows when the keyboard  moves over the picture. The lack of alt-text on these graphics prevents screen readers from  accurately vocalizing a description of the graphics. As a result, Defendant’s visually- impaired customers are unable to determine what is on the website, browse, or make any  purchases;  b.  Empty Links That Contain No Text causing the function or purpose  of the link to not be presented to the user. They can introduce confusion for keyboard and  screen-reader users;  c.  Redundant Links where adjacent links go to the same URL address  which results in additional navigation and repetition for keyboard and screen-reader users;  and  d.  Linked Images Missing Alt-text, which causes problems if an image  within a link contains no text and that image does not provide alt-text. A screen reader then  -12-  has no content to present the user as to the function of the link, including information  contained in PDFs.   32.  Many pages on the Website also contain the same title elements. This  is a problem for the visually-impaired because the screen reader fails to distinguish  one page from another. In order to fix this problem, Defendant must change the title  elements for each page.    33.  The Website also contained a host of broken links, which is a  hyperlink to a non-existent or empty webpage. For the visually-impaired this is  especially paralyzing due to the inability to navigate or otherwise determine where  one is on the website once a broken link is encountered. For example, upon coming  across a link of interest, Plaintiff was redirected to an error page. However, the  screen-reader failed to communicate that the link was broken. As a result, Plaintiff  could not get back to his original search.  Defendant Must Remove Barriers To Its Website   34.  Due to the inaccessibility of Defendant’s Website, blind and visually- impaired customers such as Plaintiff, who need screen-readers, cannot fully and equally  use or enjoy the goods, and services Defendant offers to the public on its Website. The  access barriers Plaintiff encountered have caused a denial of Plaintiff’s full and equal  access in the past, and now deter Plaintiff on a regular basis from accessing the Website.    35.  These access barriers on Defendant’s Website have deterred Plaintiff from  visiting Defendant’s Website and enjoying it equal to sighted individuals because: Plaintiff  was unable to use and enjoy the Website in the same manner as sighted individuals do,  preventing Plaintiff from using the Website to purchase items and to view the items.  -13-   36.  If the Website was equally accessible to all, Plaintiff could independently  navigate the Website and complete a desired transaction as sighted individuals do.   37.  Through his attempts to use the Website, Plaintiff has actual knowledge of  the access barriers that make these services inaccessible and independently unusable by  blind and visually-impaired persons.   38.  Because simple compliance with the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines would provide  Plaintiff and other visually-impaired consumers with equal access to the Website, Plaintiff  alleges that Defendant has engaged in acts of intentional discrimination, including but not  limited to the following policies or practices:  a.  Constructing and maintaining a website that is inaccessible to  visually-impaired individuals, including Plaintiff;  b.  Failure to construct and maintain a website that is not sufficiently  intuitive so as to be equally accessible to visually-impaired individuals, including Plaintiff;  and,  c.  Failing to take actions to correct these access barriers in the face of  substantial harm and discrimination to blind and visually-impaired consumers, such as  Plaintiff, as a member of a protected class.   39.  Defendant therefore uses standards, criteria or methods of administration  that have the effect of discriminating or perpetuating the discrimination of others, as  alleged herein.   40.  The ADA expressly contemplates the injunctive relief that Plaintiff seeks in  this action. In relevant part, the ADA requires:  In the case of violations of . . . this title, injunctive relief shall include an order to  alter facilities to make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals  -14-  with disabilities . . . Where appropriate, injunctive relief shall also include requiring  the . . . modification of a policy . . .  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(2).   41.  Because Defendant’s Website is not and has never been fully accessible,  and because, upon information and belief, Defendant does not have, and has never had,  adequate corporate policies that are reasonably calculated to cause its Website to become  and remain accessible, Plaintiff invokes 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(2) and seek a permanent  injunction requiring Defendant to:  a) Retain a qualified consultant acceptable to Plaintiff (“Web Accessibility  Consultant”) who shall assist in improving the accessibility of its Website,  including all third-party content and plug-ins, so the goods and services on the  Website may be equally accessed and enjoyed by visually-impaired persons;  b) Work with the Web Accessibility Consultant to ensure all employees involved  in Website and content development be given web accessibility training on a  biennial basis, including onsite training to create accessible content at the design  and development stages;  c) Work with the Web Accessibility Consultant to perform an automated  accessibility audit on a periodic basis to evaluate whether Defendant’s Website may  be equally accessed and enjoyed by visually-impaired persons on an ongoing basis;  d) Work with the Web Accessibility Consultant to perform end-user  accessibility/usability testing on at least a quarterly basis with said testing to be  performed by humans who are blind or have low vision, or who have training and  experience in the manner in which persons who are blind use a screen reader to  navigate, browse, and conduct business on websites, in addition to the testing, if  applicable, that is performed using semi-automated tools;  e) Incorporate all of the Web Accessibility Consultant’s recommendations within  sixty (60) days of receiving the recommendations;  f) Work with the Web Accessibility Consultant to create a Web Accessibility Policy  that will be posted on its Website, along with an e-mail address, instant messenger,  and toll-free phone number to report accessibility-related problems;  g) Directly link from the footer on each page of its Website, a statement that  indicates that Defendant is making efforts to maintain and increase the accessibility  of its Website to ensure that visually-impaired persons have full and equal  -15-  enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and  accommodations of the Defendant’s Website;  h) Accompany the public policy statement with an accessible means of submitting  accessibility questions and problems, including an accessible form to submit  feedback or an email address to contact representatives knowledgeable about the  Web Accessibility Policy;  i) Provide a notice, prominently and directly linked from the footer on each page of  its Website, soliciting feedback from visitors to the Website on how the  accessibility of the Website can be improved. The link shall provide a method to  provide feedback, including an accessible form to submit feedback or an email  address to contact representatives knowledgeable about the Web Accessibility  Policy;  j) Provide a copy of the Web Accessibility Policy to all web content personnel,  contractors responsible for web content, and Client Service Operations call center  agents (“CSO Personnel”) for the Website;  k) Train no fewer than three of its CSO Personnel to automatically escalate calls  from users with disabilities who encounter difficulties using the Website.  Defendant shall have trained no fewer than 3 of its CSO personnel to timely assist  such users with disabilities within CSO published hours of operation. Defendant  shall establish procedures for promptly directing requests for assistance to such  personnel including notifying the public that customer assistance is available to  users with disabilities and describing the process to obtain that assistance;  l) Modify existing bug fix policies, practices, and procedures to include the  elimination of bugs that cause the Website to be inaccessible to users of screen  reader technology; and  m) Plaintiff, his counsel, and their experts monitor the Website for up to two years  after the Mutually Agreed Upon Consultant validates the Website are free of  accessibility errors/violations to ensure Defendant has adopted and implemented  adequate accessibility policies. To this end, Plaintiff, through his counsel and their  experts, shall be entitled to consult with the Web Accessibility Consultant at their  discretion, and to review any written material, including but not limited to any  recommendations the Website Accessibility Consultant provides Defendant.   42.  Web-based technologies have features and content that are modified on a  daily, and in some instances an hourly, basis, and a one time “fix” to an inaccessible  website will not cause the website to remain accessible without a corresponding change in  corporate policies related to those web-based technologies. To evaluate whether an  -16-  inaccessible website has been rendered accessible, and whether corporate policies related  to web-based technologies have been changed in a meaningful manner that will cause the  website to remain accessible, the website must be reviewed on a periodic basis using both  automated accessibility screening tools and end user testing by visually-impaired persons.   43.  If the Website was accessible, Plaintiff and similarly situated blind and  visually-impaired persons could independently shop for and otherwise research the  Defendant’s products via the Website.   44.  Although Defendant may currently have centralized policies regarding  maintaining and operating its Website, Defendant lacks a plan and policy reasonably  calculated to make them fully and equally accessible to, and independently usable by, blind  and other visually-impaired consumers.    45.  Defendant has, upon information and belief, invested substantial sums in  developing and maintaining their Website and has generated significant revenue from the  Website. These amounts are far greater than the associated cost of making their Website  equally accessible to visually-impaired consumers.    46.  Without injunctive relief, Plaintiff and other visually-impaired consumers  will continue to be unable to independently use the Website, violating their rights.  47.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, seeks to  certify a nationwide class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind  individuals in the United States who have attempted to access Defendant’s Website and as  -17-  a result have been denied access to the equal enjoyment of goods and services offered by  Defendant’s Website, during the relevant statutory period.   48.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, seeks to  certify a New York State Sub-Class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally  blind individuals in the State of New York who have attempted to access Defendant’s  Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal enjoyment of goods and  services offered by Defendant’s Website, during the relevant statutory period.    49.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, seeks to  certify a New York City Sub-Class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally  blind individuals in the City of New York who have attempted to access Defendant’s  Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal enjoyment of goods and  services offered by Defendant’s Website, during the relevant statutory period.    50.  Common questions of law and fact exist amongst the Class and Sub- Classes, including:  a.  Whether Defendant’s Website is a “public accommodation” under  the ADA;   b.  Whether Defendant’s Website is a “place or provider of public  accommodation” under the NYSHRL or NYCHRL;  c.  Whether Defendant’s Website denies the full and equal enjoyment  of its goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to visually- impaired persons, violating the ADA; and  -18-  d.  Whether Defendant’s Website denies the full and equal enjoyment  of its goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to visually- impaired persons, violating the NYSHRL or NYCHRL.   51.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the Class and Sub-Classes. The Class, and  Sub-Classes, similarly to the Plaintiff, are severely visually-impaired or otherwise blind  persons, and claim that Defendant has violated the ADA, NYSHRL or NYCHRL by failing  to update or remove access barriers on its Website so it can be independently accessible to  the Class and/or the Sub-Classes.   52.  Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the  Class Members because Plaintiff has retained and is represented by counsel competent and  experienced in complex class action litigation, including ADA litigation and because  Plaintiff has no interests antagonistic to the Class Members. Class certification of the  claims is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because Defendant has acted or refused  to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, making appropriate both declaratory  and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiff and the Class as a whole.   53.  Alternatively, class certification is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(b)(3) because fact and legal questions are common to Class Members predominate over  questions affecting only individual Class Members, and because a class action is superior  to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of their litigation.   54.  Judicial economy will be served by maintaining this lawsuit as a class action  in that it is likely to avoid the burden that would be otherwise placed upon the judicial  system by the filing of numerous similar suits by visually-impaired persons throughout the  United States.  -19-  55.   Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the Class Members, repeats and realleges  every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   56.  Section 302(a) of Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., provides:  No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and  equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or  accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,  leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.  42 U.S.C. § 12182(a).   57.  Defendant’s online retail store is a place of public accommodation within  the definition of Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7). Defendant’s Website is a  service, privilege, or advantage of Defendant’s online retail store   58.  Under Section 302(b)(1) of Title III of the ADA, it is unlawful  discrimination to deny individuals with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or  benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of  an entity. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i).   59.  Under Section 302(b)(1) of Title III of the ADA, it is unlawful  discrimination to deny individuals with disabilities an opportunity to participate in or  benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodation,  which is equal to the opportunities afforded to other individuals. 42 U.S.C. §  12182(b)(1)(A)(ii).   60.  Under Section 302(b)(2) of Title III of the ADA, unlawful discrimination  also includes, among other things:  -20-  [A] failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when  such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities,  privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless  the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally  alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or  accommodations; and a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that  no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise  treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids  and services, unless the entity can demonstrate that taking such steps would  fundamentally alter the nature of the good, service, facility, privilege, advantage,  or accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden.  42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).   61.  The acts alleged herein constitute violations of Title III of the ADA, and the  regulations promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff, who is a member of a protected class of  persons under the ADA, has a physical disability that substantially limits the major life  activity of sight within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(1)(A)-(2)(A). Furthermore,  Plaintiff has been denied full and equal access to the Website, has not been provided  services that are provided to other patrons who are not disabled, and has been provided  services that are inferior to the services provided to non-disabled persons. Defendant has  failed to take any prompt and equitable steps to remedy its discriminatory conduct. These  violations are ongoing.   62.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 12188 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth  and incorporated therein, Plaintiff, requests relief as set forth below.  63.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the New York State Sub-Class Members,  repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth  herein.  -21-   64.  N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(a) provides that it is “an unlawful discriminatory  practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent  or employee of any place of public accommodation . . . because of the . . . disability of any  person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person any of the  accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof.”   65.  Defendant’s Website operates in the State of New York and constitutes an  online sales establishment and a place of public accommodation within the definition of  N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(9). Defendant’s Website is a service, privilege or advantage of  Defendant’s online retail establishment.    66.  Defendant is subject to New York Human Rights Law because it owns  and/or operates its Website in the State of New York. Defendant is a person within the  meaning of N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(1).   67.  Defendant is violating N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(a) in refusing to update or  remove access barriers to its Website, causing its Website and the services integrated  therewith to be completely inaccessible to the blind. Their inaccessibility denies blind  patrons full and equal access to the facilities, goods and services that Defendant makes  available to the non-disabled public.   68.  Under N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(c)(i), unlawful discriminatory practice  includes, among other things, “a refusal to make reasonable modifications in policies,  practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford facilities,  privileges, advantages or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless such  person can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the  -22-  nature of such facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations being offered or would  result in an undue burden\".   69.  Under N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(c)(ii), unlawful discriminatory practice  also includes, “a refusal to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual  with a disability is excluded or denied services because of the absence of auxiliary aids and  services, unless such person can demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally  alter the nature of the facility, privilege, advantage or accommodation being offered or  would result in an undue burden.”   70.  Readily available, well-established guidelines exist on the Internet for  making websites accessible to the blind and visually-impaired. These guidelines have been  followed by other large business entities and government agencies in making their website  accessible, including but not limited to: adding alt-text to graphics and ensuring that all  functions can be performed using a keyboard. Incorporating the basic components to make  its Website accessible would neither fundamentally alter the nature of Defendant’s business  nor result in an undue burden to Defendant.   71.  Defendant’s actions constitute willful intentional discrimination against the  class on the basis of a disability in violation of the NYSHRL, N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2) in  that Defendant has:  a.  constructed and maintained a website that is inaccessible to blind  class members with knowledge of the discrimination; and/or  b.  constructed and maintained a website that is not sufficiently  intuitive and/or obvious that it is inaccessible to blind class members; and/or  -23-  c.  failed to take actions to correct these access barriers in the face of  substantial harm and discrimination to blind class members.   72.  Defendant has failed to take any prompt and equitable steps to remedy their  discriminatory conduct. These violations are ongoing.   73.  Defendant discriminates, and will continue in the future to discriminate,  against Plaintiff and New York State Sub-Class Members on the basis of disability in the  full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,  accommodations and/or opportunities of Defendant’s Website under § 296(2) et seq. and/or  its implementing regulations. Unless the Court enjoins Defendant from continuing to  engage in these unlawful practices, Plaintiff and the Sub-Class Members will continue to  suffer irreparable harm.   74.  Defendant’s actions were and are in violation of New York State Human  Rights Law and therefore Plaintiff invokes his right to injunctive relief to remedy the  discrimination.   75.  Plaintiff is also entitled to compensatory damages, as well as civil penalties  and fines under N.Y. Exec. Law § 297(4)(c) et seq. for each and every offense.   76.  Plaintiff is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.   77.  Under N.Y. Exec. Law § 297 and the remedies, procedures and rights set  forth and incorporated therein Plaintiff prays for judgment as set forth below.  78.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the New York City Sub-Class Members,  repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth  herein.   79.  N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-107(4)(a) provides that “It shall be an  unlawful discriminatory practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor,  manager, superintendent, agent or employee of any place or provider of public  accommodation, because of . . . disability . . . directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold  from or deny to such person, any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or  privileges thereof.”   80.  Defendant’s website is an online sales establishment and a place of public  accommodation within the definition of N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(9), and its Website  is a service that is integrated with its online sales establishment.   81.  Defendant is subject to NYCHRL because it owns and/or operates its  Website in the City of New York, making it a person within the meaning of N.Y.C. Admin.  Code § 8-102(1).   82.  Defendant is violating N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-107(4)(a) in  refusing to update or remove access barriers to Website, causing its Website and the  services integrated therewith to be completely inaccessible to the blind. The inaccessibility  denies blind consumers full and equal access to the facilities, goods, and services that  Defendant makes available to the non-disabled public.   83.  Defendant is required to “make reasonable accommodation to the needs of  persons with disabilities . . . any person prohibited by the provisions of [§ 8-107 et seq.]  from discriminating on the basis of disability shall make reasonable accommodation to  -25-  enable a person with a disability to . . . enjoy the right or rights in question provided that  the disability is known or should have been known by the covered entity.” N.Y.C. Admin.  Code § 8-107(15)(a).   84.  Defendant’s actions constitute willful intentional discrimination against the  Sub-Class on the basis of a disability in violation of the N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8- 107(4)(a) and § 8-107(15)(a) in that Defendant has:  a.  constructed and maintained a website that is inaccessible to blind  class members with knowledge of the discrimination; and/or  b.  constructed and maintained a website that is not sufficiently  intuitive and/or obvious that it is inaccessible to blind class members; and/or  c.  failed to take actions to correct these access barriers in the face of  substantial harm and discrimination to blind class members.   85.  Defendant has failed to take any prompt and equitable steps to remedy their  discriminatory conduct. These violations are ongoing.   86.  As such, Defendant discriminates, and will continue in the future to  discriminate, against Plaintiff and members of the proposed class and Sub-Class on the  basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities,  privileges, advantages, accommodations and/or opportunities of its Website under § 8- 107(4)(a) and/or its implementing regulations. Unless the Court enjoins Defendant from  continuing to engage in these unlawful practices, Plaintiff and members of the Sub-Class  will continue to suffer irreparable harm.   87.  Defendant’s actions were and are in violation of the NYCHRL and therefore  Plaintiff invokes his right to injunctive relief to remedy the discrimination.  -26-   88.  Plaintiff is also entitled to compensatory damages, as well as civil penalties  and fines under N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-120(8) and § 8-126(a) for each offense as  well as punitive damages pursuant to § 8-502.   89.  Plaintiff is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.   90.  Under N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-120 and § 8-126 and the remedies,  procedures and rights set forth and incorporated therein Plaintiff prays for judgment as set  forth below.  91.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the Class and New York State and City  Sub-Classes Members, repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs  as if fully set forth herein.   92.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the parties in that  Plaintiff contends, and is informed and believes that Defendant denies, that its Website  contains access barriers denying blind customers the full and equal access to the goods and  services of its Website, which Defendant owns, operates and controls, fails to comply with  applicable laws including, but not limited to, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities  Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182, et seq., N.Y. Exec. Law § 296, et seq., and N.Y.C. Admin. Code  § 8-107, et seq. prohibiting discrimination against the blind.   93.  A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that  each of the parties may know their respective rights and duties and act accordingly.

      "55.  Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil   Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3) on behalf of a class, consisting of all those who purchased or  otherwise acquired Cnova securities: (1) pursuant and/or traceable to the Company’s  Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with the Company’s IPO on or about  November 19, 2014, seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Act; and/or (2) between  November 19, 2014 and December 18, 2015, inclusive, seeking to pursue remedies under the  Exchange Act; and were damaged thereby (collectively, the “Class”). Excluded from the Class  are Defendants, the officers and directors of the Company, at all relevant times, members of their  immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns and any entity in  which Defendants have or had a controlling interest.   56.  The members of the Class are so numerous that joinder of all members is  impracticable. Throughout the Class Period, Cnova’s securities were actively traded on the  Nasdaq Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”). While the exact number of Class members is unknown  to Plaintiff at this time and can only be ascertained through appropriate discovery, Plaintiff  believes that there are hundreds or thousands of members in the proposed Class. Millions of  Cnova shares were traded publicly during the Class Period on the NASDAQ. Record owners and  other members of the Class may be identified from records maintained by Cnova or its transfer  agent and may be notified of the pendency of this action by mail, using the form of notice similar  to that customarily used in securities class actions.   66.  As alleged herein, Defendants acted with scienter in that Defendants knew that  the public documents and statements issued or disseminated in the name of the Company were  materially false and/or misleading; knew that such statements or documents would be issued or  disseminated to the investing public; and knowingly and substantially participated or acquiesced  in the issuance or dissemination of such statements or documents as primary violations of the  federal securities laws. As set forth elsewhere herein in detail, Defendants, by virtue of their  receipt of information reflecting the true facts regarding Cnova, his/her control over, and/or  receipt and/or modification of Cnova’s allegedly materially misleading misstatements and/or  their associations with the Company which made them privy to confidential proprietary  information concerning Cnova, participated in the fraudulent scheme alleged herein.  72.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained above as if  fully set forth herein, except any allegation of fraud, recklessness or intentional misconduct.   73.  This Count is brought pursuant to Section 11 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.  §77k, on behalf of the Class, against the Section 11 Defendants.   74.  The Registration Statement for the IPO was inaccurate and misleading, contained  untrue statements of material facts, omitted to state other facts necessary to make the statements  made not misleading, and omitted to state material facts required to be stated therein.   75.  Cnova is the registrant for the IPO. The Section 11 Defendants named herein were  responsible for the contents and dissemination of the Registration Statement.   76.  As issuer of the shares, Cnova is strictly liable to Plaintiff and the Class for the  misstatements and omissions.   77.  None of the Section 11 Defendants named herein made a reasonable investigation  or possessed reasonable grounds for the belief that the statements contained in the Registration  Statement were true and without omissions of any material facts and were not misleading.   78.  By reasons of the conduct herein alleged, each Section 11 Defendant violated,  and/or controlled a person who violated Section 11 of the Securities Act.   81.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges each and every allegation contained above as if  fully set forth herein, except any allegation of fraud, recklessness or intentional misconduct.   82.  This count is asserted against the Section 11 Individual Defendants and is based  upon Section 15 of the Securities Act.   83.  The Section 11 Individual Defendants, by virtue of their offices, directorship, and  specific acts were, at the time of the wrongs alleged herein and as set forth herein, controlling  persons of Cnova within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. The Section 11  Individual Defendants had the power and influence and exercised the same to cause Cnova to  engage in the acts described herein.   84.  The Section 11 Individual Defendants’ positions made them privy to and provided  them with actual knowledge of the material facts concealed from Plaintiff and the Class.   85.  By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, the Section 11 Individual Defendants are  liable for the aforesaid wrongful conduct and are liable to Plaintiff and the Class for damages  suffered.  Background    Violation of Section 10(b) of The Exchange Act   and Rule 10b-5 Promulgated Thereunder   (Against the Company and the Individual Defendants)   Violation of Section 11 of The Securities Act  (Against the Section 11 Defendants)    Violation of Section 15 of The Securities Act  (Against the Section 11 Individual Defendants)  \n",

      "25.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Plaintiff brings this action on  behalf of himself and a Nationwide Class of similarly situated persons defined as follows:  The Nationwide Class. All Releasees from Federal prison in the  United States who, within the applicable statute of limitations  preceding the filing of this action to the date of class certification,  incurred bank fees on a JPMorgan Chase debit card or currently  have an unused balance on a JPMorgan Chase debit card under  $20.   26.  Additionally, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Plaintiff brings this  action on behalf of himself and a Multi-State Class of similarly situated persons defined as  follows:  The Multi-State Class. All Releasees from Federal prison in the  United States, except for the State of Iowa, who, within the  applicable statute of limitations preceding the filing of this action  to the date of class certification, incurred bank fees on a JPMorgan  Chase debit card or currently have an unused balance on a  JPMorgan Chase debit card under $20.  7   27.  Together, the Nationwide Class and the Multi-State Class are the “Class” or the  “Classes.”   28.  Plaintiff reserves the right to modify or amend the definition of the proposed  Class before the Court determines whether certification is appropriate.   29.  Excluded from the Class is Defendant, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers,  and directors, any entity in which Defendant has a controlling interest, all customers who make a  timely election to be excluded, governmental entities, and all judges assigned to hear any aspect  of this litigation, as well as their immediate family members.   30.  Numerosity. The members of the Class are so numerous that joinder is  impractical. The Classes consist of thousands of members, the identity of whom is within the  knowledge of Defendant and can be ascertained only by resort to Defendant’s records.   31.  Typicality. The representative Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the  Class in that the representative Plaintiff, like all Class members, was defaulted into using a  JPMorgan Chase debit card and then prevented from accessing the full amount of his personal  funds without interference, obstacles, and fees.  The representative Plaintiff, like all Class  members, has been damaged by Defendant’s misconduct in that he has been forced to use a  JPMorgan Chase debit card to access his own funds and has been assessed, has been prevented  from fully accessing all funds, and/or will continue to be assessed unfair and unconscionable  bank fees. Furthermore, the factual basis of Defendant’s misconduct is common to all Class  members and represents a common thread of unfair and unconscionable conduct resulting in  injury to all members of the Class.   32.  Commonality and Predominance. There are numerous questions of law and fact  common to the Class, and those common questions predominate over any questions affecting  8  only individual Class members. Among the questions of law and fact common to the Classes are  whether Defendant:  a.  automatically opens debit card accounts for Releasees without  consent;  b.  imposes contractual forms upon Releasees, without providing  Releasees with the meaningful ability to review or approve the  terms of those contracts;  c.  deceives Releasees about, and does not adequately disclose, ATM  fees by, among other things, charging, in effect, two service fees  for every non-JPMorgan Chase ATM withdrawal;  d.  forces persons to forfeit unused balances on debit cards;  e.  converts money belonging to Plaintiff and the other members of  the Classes through its policies and practices;  f.  is unjustly enriched through its policies and practices; and  g.  violates the consumer protection acts of various states through its  policies and practices.   33.  Additional questions of law and fact common to the Classes include:  a.  the proper method or methods by which to measure damages; and  b.  the declaratory relief to which the Classes are entitled.   34.   Adequacy of representation. Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the  other Class members, in that they arise out of Defendant’s same wrongful policies and practices.  Plaintiff has suffered the harm alleged herein and has no interests antagonistic to the interests of  the other Class members. Plaintiff is committed to the vigorous prosecution of this action and has  retained competent counsel experienced in the prosecution of class actions and, in particular,  class actions on behalf of consumers and against financial institutions. For these reasons,  Plaintiff is an adequate representative and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the  Class.  9   35.  Superiority. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and  efficient adjudication of this controversy. Since the amount of each individual Class member’s  claim is small relative to the complexity of the litigation, and due to the financial resources of  Defendant, no Class member could afford to seek legal redress individually for the claims  alleged herein. Consequently, absent a class action, the Class members will continue to suffer  losses and Defendant’s misconduct will proceed without remedy.   36.  Even if Class members themselves could afford such individual litigation, the  court system could not. Given the complex legal and factual issues involved, individualized  litigation would significantly increase the delay and expense to all parties and to the Court.  Individualized litigation would also create the potential for inconsistent or contradictory rulings.  By contrast, a class action presents far fewer management difficulties, allows claims to be heard  that might otherwise go unheard because of the relative expense of bringing individual lawsuits,  and provides the benefits of economies of scale and of adjudication and comprehensive  supervision by a single court.  37.  In Federal prisons, JPMorgan Chase issues debit cards to inmates when they are  released that contain the balances remaining in their prison accounts. The accounts are funded  with both contributions from inmates’ friends and family and with monies the inmates earned for  work in prison, as well as monies in the possession of inmates at the time of their arrest.   38.  Released inmates have no choice but to accept the JPMorgan Chase debit cards,  as the prisons foist the cards upon the Releasees on their way out, and the cards are the only  means by which a Releasee can receive funds that he or she owns and has a right to possess,  10  unencumbered—money earned, often times, at the rate of 17 cents an hour in prison jobs.   39.  No contract is created between Releasees and JPMorgan Chase at the time of  release. The inmate is handed minimal information without explanation or an opportunity to  agree or disagree.    40.  JPMorgan Chase has a (literally) captive market and exploits its unfettered power  to gouge Releasees—just at the moment they begin their attempt to reintegrate into society.   41.  Releasees later discover that Defendant charges them fees for accessing their own  or for failing to access their money quickly enough for Defendant’s liking. Releasees also  discover they are forced to forfeit remaining balances on debit cards that they cannot use.   42.  Not only does JPMorgan Chase have contractual basis for assessing any fees, but  the fees it does assess are excessive and unconscionable. For example, unless a Releasee can  locate a JPMorgan Chase ATM, JPMorgan Chase charges two separate ATM withdrawal fees for  each ATM withdrawal: a $2.00 fee for itself and a fee of $2.50 to $4 for use of the non- JPMorgan Chase ATM. Shockingly, a Releasee thus faces a $5.00 charge or more to make a  single ATM withdrawal if he or she cannot locate a Chase ATM.   43.  Even after JPMorgan Chase issues the debit card, JPMorgan Chase does  everything it can to keep Releasees locked into the debit card. For example, JPMorgan Chase  makes it cost-prohibitive for a Releasee to receive his or her funds in cash, even after release.  Indeed, if a Releasee simply walks in to a JPMorgan Chase branch and asks for the branch to  provide the funds on his debit card to him in cash, JPMorgan Chase will charge an astounding  $10.00 for that “privilege.”  11   44.  The $10.00 cash conversion fee exists solely to disincentivize Releasees from  receiving their funds in cash and to force Releasees to use the JPMorgan Chase debit card issued  to them without their consent.   45.  Market surveys indicate that such cash withdrawal fees are unheard of in the debit  card market.  For example, another Chase debit card product offered on the open market, Chase  Liquid, provides this same service for free.  Direct Express does as well.  Wal-Mart and Western  Union charge just $2.     46.  Similarly, JP Morgan Chase charges a shocking $15 for the issuance of a check  for funds in an debit card account.  Chase’s “Liquid” debit card charges just $8 for this service— and Western Union charges just $5.95 for check issuance.   47.  JPMorgan Chase has an obvious incentive to force Releasees to use its debit  cards. Via payments network rules, JPMorgan Chase earns money every time an inmate uses a  card for a debit card purchase or for an ATM withdrawal. To make sure Releasees use their debit  cards in a way that makes money for the Bank, JPMorgan Chase makes it difficult for Releasees  to remove their funds from their debit cards—either via an over the counter withdrawal or via a  check.   48.  JPMorgan Chase also reaps significant fee income from forcing Releasees to use  its debit cards. For example, it charges 45 cents merely to check a balance at an ATM, $1.50 if  an account is inactive for 90 days, $7.50 to replace the card a second time within a year, and  $0.25 for declined point-of-sale (“POS”) transactions, and it charges for the use of non- JPMorgan Chase ATMs.   49.  Even small penalties can be both more significant—and more devastating—for  newly-released prisoners, who may have less money and banking experience and who face many  12  other barriers to reintegrating into society.   50.  The harshness of the fee structure is designed to ensure that users will forfeit  small, remaining balances to the Bank because of the difficulty or impossibility of retrieving  them. This feature acts as another, hidden fee imposed on users of the JPMorgan Chase debit  cards.   51.  Indeed, the under-use of balances is a well-known phenomenon in the similar gift- card industry. As much as $41 billion in gift-card value has gone unused since 2005, according  to research firm TowerGroup, often due to the inability to “use up” remaining balances.   52.  Upon information and belief, the same phenomenon impacts the JP Morgan  Chase’s debit cards foisted upon Releasees—to JP Morgan Chase’s great benefit.   53.  JPMorgan Chase’s fee schedule prevents Releasees from fully “using up” the  funds placed on their debit cards. Balances under $20.00 are not retrievable at an ATM. An in- person withdrawal at a Bank branch costs $10.00, making it impossible to retrieve a remaining  balance under that amount. And the Bank provides no indication anywhere in the debit card  documentation, website, or other materials that a check refund of the remaining balance is a  possibility—and charges $15 for the right even when a debit card holder seeks a check.  II.  Conversion  (On Behalf of the Classes)  126.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding and subsequent paragraphs as though  set forth herein.  127.  Defendant had, and continues to have, a duty to maintain and preserve debit  cardholders’ funds and to prevent their diminishment through its own wrongful acts.  128.  Defendant has, without proper authorization, assumed and exercised the right of  ownership over these funds, in hostility to the rights of Plaintiff and the Class members, without  legal justification.  24  129.  Defendant continues to retain the funds unlawfully and without the consent of  Plaintiff or the Class members.  130.  Defendant intends to permanently deprive Plaintiff and the Class members of the  funds.  131.  Plaintiff and the Class members properly own the funds, not Defendant, who now  claims it is entitled to their ownership, contrary to the rights of Plaintiff and the Class members.  132.  Plaintiff and the Class members are entitled to the immediate possession of the  funds.  133.  Defendant has wrongfully converted the specific and readily identifiable funds.  134.  Defendant’s wrongful conduct is continuing.  135.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s wrongful conversion of their  funds, Plaintiff and the members of the Classes have suffered and continue to suffer damages.  136.  By reason of the foregoing, Plaintiff and the members of the Classes seek to  recover from Defendant all damages and costs permitted by law, including all amounts that  Defendant has wrongfully converted.  137.  Therefore, Plaintiff prays for relief as set forth below.  I.  BACKGROUND   Unjust Enrichment  (On Behalf of the Classes)  118.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding and subsequent paragraphs as though  set forth herein, excepting those paragraphs that allege the existence of a valid contract.  119.  By means of Defendant’s wrongful conduct alleged herein, Defendant knowingly  received and retained wrongful benefits and funds from Plaintiff and the members of the Classes.   In so doing, Defendant acted with conscious disregard for the rights of Plaintiff and the members  of the Classes.  120.  As a result of Defendant’s wrongful conduct as alleged herein, Defendant has  been unjustly enriched at the expense of, and to the detriment of, Plaintiff and the Class  members.  23  121.  Defendant’s unjust enrichment is traceable to, and resulted directly and  proximately from, the conduct alleged herein.  122.  Under the common law doctrine of unjust enrichment, it is inequitable for  Defendant to retain the benefits it received, and is still receiving, without justification, from the  imposition of bank fees on debit cards in an unfair, unconscionable, and oppressive manner.  Defendant’s retention of such funds under circumstances making it inequitable to do so  constitutes unjust enrichment.  123.  The financial benefits Defendant derived rightfully belong to Plaintiff and the  Class members. Defendant should be compelled to disgorge in a common fund, for the benefit of  Plaintiff and the Class members, all wrongful or inequitable proceeds Defendant received. A  constructive trust should be imposed upon all wrongful or inequitable sums Defendant received  traceable to Plaintiff and the Class members.  124.  Plaintiff and the members of the Classes have no adequate remedy at law.  125.  Therefore, Plaintiff prays for relief as set forth below.  Violation of New York’s Consumer Protection from Deceptive Acts and Practices Act,  N.Y. GEN. BUS. LAW. § 349 et seq.  New York General Business Law Section 349  (On Behalf of the Classes)  138.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding and subsequent paragraphs as though  set forth herein.  139.  Plaintiff brings this claim on behalf of the Classes for violation of section 349 of  New York’s Consumer Protection from Deceptive Acts and Practices Act, N.Y. GEN. BUS. LAW  25  § 349 et seq.  140.  Section 349 prohibits “[d]eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any  business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in [the State of New York].”  N.Y. GEN. BUS. LAW § 349(a).  141.  As described herein, Defendant engaged, and continues to engage, in deceptive,  unfair, and unconscionable acts and practices in violation of section 349 by automatically  creating debit cards for Plaintiff and the Class members, placing all of Plaintiff’s and the Class  members’ funds on the debit cards, and then making it impossible for Plaintiff and the Class  members to fully consume all of the funds on the cards—all without Plaintiff’s or the Class  members’ consent.  142.  Plaintiff and the Class members had no reasonable choice other than to go along  with Defendant’s conduct of forcing them to accept their funds on debit cards when they were  released from Federal prison, and once the funds were on the debit cards, Plaintiff and the Class  members had no reasonable option other than to pay the deceptive, unfair, and unconscionable  fees Defendant charged, which prevented Plaintiff and the Class members from receiving all of  their money upon their release from prison. Plaintiff and the Class members would not have  accepted Defendant’s debit cards if they had known it was impossible for them to receive the  entirety of their funds via the debit cards.  143.  Plaintiff and the Class members were injured in fact and lost money as a result of  Defendant’s deceptive, unfair, and unconscionable acts and practices for all of the reasons set  forth above, including but not limited to (i) because Plaintiff and the Class members were unable  to recover the entirety of their money from Defendant’s debit cards and, consequently, never had  an opportunity to recover the entirety of their own money on their release from prison and (ii)  26  because Defendant charged Plaintiff and the Class members deceptive, unfair, and  unconscionable fees for use of its debits as fully described above.  144.  By reason of the foregoing, Defendant’s conduct, as alleged herein, constitutes  deceptive acts and practices in violation of section 349, and Plaintiff and the Class members seek  recovery of the actual damages they have suffered as a result of Defendant’s actions. The amount  of such damages is to be determined at trial, but will not be less than $50 per act. N.Y. GEN. BUS.  LAW § 349(h).  145.  Plaintiff and the Class members seek to enjoin such unlawful, deceptive acts and  practices described above. Each of the Class members will be irreparably harmed unless the  Court enjoins Defendant’s unlawful, deceptive, unfair, and unconscionable actions.  146.  Plaintiff and the Class members seek declaratory relief, restitution for monies  wrongfully obtained, disgorgement of ill-gotten revenues and/or profits, injunctive relief  prohibiting Defendant from, inter alia, continuing to force Releasees to use its debit cards on  release from Federal prison and continuing to charge deceptive, unfair, and unconscionable fees  for use of the cards, and other relief allowable under section 349.  147.  Therefore, Plaintiff prays for relief as set forth below. \n",

      "37.  In order to provide services to many of its customers, Clean Harbors contracts  with certain companies to provide it with employees to perform the necessary work.    38.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers reported directly to Clean Harbors.   39.  Over the past three years, Clean Harbors employed hundreds of individuals –  including Metro – as Solid Control Techs (or similar positions) throughout the United States.    40.  Many of these individuals worked for Clean Harbors on a day-rate basis without  overtime and were classified as independent contractors.    41.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers worked for Clean Harbors under this pay  scheme.    42.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers did not receive a salary. If Metro and the Day  Rate Workers did not work, they did not get paid.    43.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers received a day rate.    44.  Metro received a day rate of $275.00 for each approved day he worked for Clean  Harbors.   45.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers received the day rate regardless of the number  of hours they worked in excess of 40 hours in a work week.    46.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers did not receive overtime pay.    47.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers are subjected to the same or similar pay  practices.    49.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers often worked at least 12 hours a day, often 7  days a week.    50.  For example, from November 9, 2017 to November 22, 2017, Metro worked for  Clean Harbors on 13 of the 14 days.    51.  In other words, Metro worked at least 84 hours in one week, and at least 72 hours  in the other week, in the two-week period of November 9, 2017 to November 22, 2017.   52.  Without the job performed by Metro and the Day Rate Workers, Clean Harbors  would not be able to complete its business objectives.    53.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers relied on Clean Harbors for work and  compensation.    54.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers worked in accordance with the schedule set by  Clean Harbors.    55.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers were not permitted by Clean Harbors to  subcontract out the work they are assigned to do by Clean Harbors.    56.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers must follow Clean Harbors’ policies and  procedures.    57.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers’ work must adhere to the quality standards put  in place by Clean Harbors.    58.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers did not substantially invest in the tools required  to complete the overall job to which they were assigned.    59.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers did not possess any specialized or unique skill  set.    61.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers worked exclusively for Clean Harbors during  the relevant time period.    62.  Metro and the Day Rate Workers did not incur operating expenses like rent,  payroll, marketing, and insurance.    63.  Clean Harbors set Metro and the Day Rate Workers’ work schedule which  prohibited them from working other jobs for other companies while working on jobs for Clean  Harbors.   64.  At all relevant time, Clean Harbors maintained control, oversight, and direction of  Metro and the Day Rate Workers, including, but not limited to, hiring, firing, disciplining,  timekeeping, payroll, and other employment practices.     65.  Clean Harbors knows Metro, and the other workers like him, worked more than  40 hours in a week.   66.  Indeed, Clean Harbors required Metro and the Day Rate Workers to work  substantial overtime without overtime compensation.    67.  Clean Harbors classified Metro and the Day Rate Workers as exempt from the  overtime requirements, as independent contractors.    68.  Clean Harbors knows these workers are not exempt from the FLSA’s overtime  provisions.   69.  Nonetheless, Clean Harbors failed to pay Metro and the other Day Rate Workers  overtime for those hours exceeding 40 in a workweek.    70.  Clean Harbors is well aware of the overtime requirements of the FLSA.    71.  The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division has found multiple  violations against Clean Harbors.  \n",

      "34.  Plaintiff brings this action on her own behalf, and on behalf of a nationwide class  pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), 23(b)(2), and/or 23(b)(3).    Nationwide Class:  All persons or entities in the United States who had RushCard accounts prior to October  12, 2015 and were denied access to their accounts and funds on at least one occasion  from October 12, 2015 to the present.   35.  In the alternative to the Nationwide Class, and pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 23(c)(5),  Plaintiff seeks to represent the following state class only in the event that the Court declines to certify  the Nationwide Class above.  Specifically, the state class consists of the following:   Pennsylvania Class:  All persons or entities in Pennsylvania who had RushCard accounts prior to October 12,  2015 and were denied access to their accounts and funds on at least one occasion from  October 12, 2015 to the present.   36.  Together, the Nationwide Class and the Pennsylvania Class shall be collectively referred  to herein as the “Class.”  Excluded from the Class are Defendants, their affiliates, employees, officers  and directors, persons or entities that have RushCards, and the Judge(s) assigned to this case.  Plaintiff  reserves the right to modify, change, or expand the Class definitions based on discovery and further  investigation.     44.  Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class (or, in the alternative, the Pennsylvania Class)  incorporate by reference each preceding and succeeding paragraph as though fully set forth at length  herein.    45.  The conduct alleged above constitutes unfair methods of competition or unfair or  deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 201-2(4)(v),(vii), (xiv) and (xxi) of the UTPCPL, 73  Pa. C.S.A. §§ 201-1, et seq.   46.  Defendants used and employed unfair methods of competition and/or unfair or deceptive  acts or practices within the meaning of 73 Pa. C.S.A. §§ 201-2 and 201-3   47.  Plaintiff and Class members are consumers who signed up for RushCard accounts.   58.  Plaintiff and the Class incorporate by reference each preceding and succeeding paragraph  as though fully set forth at length herein.   59.  A contract was created between Defendants and Plaintiff and each member of the  putative Class at the time they signed up for a RushCard account.     60.  As consideration for Defendants’ offer of a safe and convenient place to store their funds,  Plaintiff and the putative Class deposited their funds into RushCard accounts and paid monthly fees and  other charges for their RushCards.   61.  Defendants breached the terms of the contracts with Plaintiff and the putative Class by  denying them access to their accounts and funds.    62.  Plaintiff notified Defendants of the breach within a reasonable time, and/or was not  required to do so because affording Defendants a reasonable opportunity to cure their breach of contract  warranty would have been futile.  63.  Plaintiff and the Class incorporate by reference each preceding and succeeding paragraph  as though fully set forth at length herein.    67.  Plaintiff and the Class incorporate by reference each preceding and succeeding paragraph  as though fully set forth at length herein.   68.  Defendants owed duties to Plaintiff and the putative Class to use reasonable care to  protect, secure, and make readily accessible their customers’ funds.    69.  Defendants breached their duties to Plaintiff and the putative Class by failing to provide  their customers with access their funds and accounts.    70.  Defendants breached their duties to Plaintiff and the putative Class by failing to provide  computer systems that were capable of providing timely access to their customers’ accounts and funds.    71.  Defendants breached their duties to Plaintiff and the putative Class by failing to institute  measures to secure customer funds and provide their customers with timely and accurate account  balances and funds.    72.  Defendants breached their duties to communicate accurate information about the  computer system update and when customers could access their accounts and funds.    75.  Plaintiff and the Class incorporate by reference each preceding and succeeding paragraph  as though fully set forth at length herein.   76.  As the intended and expected result of their conscious wrongdoing, Defendants have  profited and benefited from the purchase of RushCards by Plaintiff and the Class.   77.  Defendants have voluntarily accepted and retained these profits and benefits, with full  knowledge and awareness that, as a result of Defendants’ misconduct, Plaintiff and the Class were not  receiving RushCards of the quality or value that had been represented by Defendants, and that  reasonable consumers expected.   78.  Defendants have been unjustly enriched by their fraudulent and deceptive withholding of  benefits to Plaintiff and the Class, at the expense of these parties.   79.  Equity and good conscience militate against permitting Defendants to retain these profits  and benefits.  80.  Plaintiff and the Class incorporate by reference each preceding and succeeding  paragraph as though fully set forth at length herein.   81.  Plaintiff and the members of the putative Class all deposited funds into their RushCard  accounts prior to October 12, 2015.   85.  Plaintiff and the Class incorporate by reference each preceding and succeeding  paragraph as though fully set forth at length herein.   86.  Defendants owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff and the putative Class to protect, secure,  and provide access to all funds that lawfully belonged to Plaintiff and the putative Class.   87.  Defendants breached those fiduciary duties by denying access to funds that Defendants  had no lawful right to deny and levied unlawful fees on Plaintiff and the putative Class during the  times Plaintiff and the putative Class were denied access to their funds.    88.  As a result, Plaintiff and the putative Class have been damaged in an amount to be  proven at trial.

      "(For Unfair Business Practices Against All Named Defendants and Does 1  Through 10)   (For Violation of California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2) Against All Named Defendants  and Does 1 through 10)   18. Cumulus provides the Broadcast Service to members of the public in  2 4  California and elsewhere, and broadcasts sound recordings through numerous radio  2 5  stations throughout California, including, without limitation, the following:  26  (a)  27  28  1116419vl  Fresno: (i) KSKS- 93.7 FM; (ii) KMGV- 97.9 FM; and (iii) KWYE  2 3   24. Plaintiff brings this action, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, on behalf of  itself individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated owners of Pre-1972  recordings, which recordings were reproduced, perfonned, distributed or otherwise  exploited by Cumulus via the Music Service in California. The proposed Class is  comprised of and defined as follows:  All owners of sound recordings of musical performances that  initially were \"fixed\" (i.e., recorded) prior to February 15, 1972,  which sound recordings were reproduced, performed, distributed  and/or otherwise exploited by Cumulus via any form or method of  delivery or storage (e.g., terrestrial broadcast, Internet, computer,  server, etc.) in California (the \"Class\").   25. This action may be properly brought and maintained as a class action  2 6  because there is a well-defined community of interest in the litigation and the members  2 7  of the proposed Class are clearly and easily ascertainable and identifiable.  28  6  31. Plaintiff hereby incorporates the allegations set forth above in paragraphs 1  through 3 0 above, as though fully set forth herein.   32. Pursuant to California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2), Plaintiff and the members of  the Class possess exclusive ownership interests in and to the Pre-1972 Recordings,  including the artistic performances embodied in those recordings.   33. Through its unauthorized reproduction, performance, distribution, or other  exploitation via the Music Service of Pre-1972 Recordings (including the Recordings)  in California, Cumulus has infringed the exclusive ownership interests in and to the  Pre-1972 Recordings in violation of California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2).   34. As a direct and proximate consequence of Cumulus's violation of  California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2), Cumulus has received and retained money and  value that rightfully belongs to Plaintiff and the members of the Class.  3 5. As a direct and proximate consequence of Cumulus's violation of  California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2), Plaintiff and the Class have been damaged in an  amount that is not as yet fully ascertained but which Plaintiff will ascertain and present  through competent evidence at trial, but which is no less than $5 million.   36. Cumulus's conduct is causing, and unless enjoined and restrained by this  Court will continue to cause Plaintiff and the Class great and irreparable injury that  cannot fully be compensated or measured in money. Plaintiff and each member of the  9  38. Pursuant to California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2) and California common law,  1 o Plaintiff and the Class possess exclusive ownership interests in and to the Pre-1972  11 Recordings, including the artistic performances embodied in those recordings.  12  3 9. Plaintiff and its predecessors in interest invested substantial time and  money in developing the Recordings.   40. Because Cumulus does not obtain licenses, it does not incur any of the  costs that a licensee is otherwise obligated to pay in order to reproduce, perform,  distribute or otherwise exploit via the Music Service Pre-1972 Recordings (including  17 the Recordings).  18   41. Cumulus has misappropriated, and continues to misappropriate, for its own  19 commercial benefit, the exclusive ownership interests in and to the Pre-1972  2 o Recordings reproducing, performing, distributing or otherwise exploiting via the Music  21 Service Pre-1972 Recordings (including the Recordings).  22   42. As a direct and proximate consequence of Cumulus's misappropriation,  2 3  Cumulus has received and retained money and value that rightfully belongs to Plaintiff  2 4  and the Class.  2 5   43. As a direct and proximate consequence of Cumulus's misappropriation,  2 6  Plaintiff and the Class have been damaged in an amount that is not as yet fully  27  28  10  46.

Pursuant to California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2) and California common law,  Plaintiff and the Class possess exclusive ownership interests in and to the Pre-1972  Recordings, including the artistic performances embodied in those recordings.   48. Cumulus's conduct in reproducing, performing, distributing, or other  exploitation via the Music Service Pre-1972 Recordings (including the Recordings)  constitutes a misappropriation of the property rights of the Plaintiff and the Class in the  Pre-1972 Recordings and a violation of California Civil Code§ 980(a)(2).  11  6  (For Misappropriation Against All Named Defendants and Does 1 Through 10)  7  3 7.

A class action is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication of the class  members’ claims as Congress specifically envisioned class actions as a principal means of  enforcing the FDCPA. See 15 U.S.C.§ 1692k.  The members of the class are generally  unsophisticated consumers, whose rights will not be vindicated in the absence of a class action.  Prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the classes would also create the risk  of inconsistent or varying adjudications resulting in the establishment of inconsistent or varying  standards and would not be in the best interest of judicial economy.    17.

DEFENDANT’s pre-recorded message fails to identify the name of the debt  collector in an attempt to trick the consumer into calling DEFENDANT back.   23.

      "21.  Defendant is a swimwear company that owns and operates the website,  www.dolfinswimwear.com (its “Website”), offering features which should allow  all consumers to access the goods and services which Defendant ensures the  delivery of throughout the United States, including New York State.   22.  Defendant’s Website offers its products and services for online sale and general  delivery to the public. The Website offers features which ought to allow users to  browse for items, access navigation bar descriptions and prices, and avail  consumers of the ability to peruse the numerous items offered for sale.   23.  Plaintiff is a visually-impaired and legally blind person, who cannot use a computer  without the assistance of screen-reading software. Plaintiff is, however, a proficient  NVDA screen-reader user and uses it to access the Internet. Plaintiff has visited the  Website using a screen-reader.   24.  Plaintiff most recently visited Defendant’s website in February of 2020 to  potentially make a purchase. Despite his efforts, however, Plaintiff was denied a  user experience similar to that of a sighted individual due to the website’s lack of a  variety of features and accommodations, which effectively barred Plaintiff from  being able to enjoy the privileges and benefits of Defendant’s public  accommodation.   26.  Many features on the Website also fail to contain a proper label element or title  attribute for each field. This is a problem for the visually impaired because the  screen reader fails to communicate the purpose of the page element. It also leads to  the user not being able to understand what he or she is expected to insert into the  subject field. As a result, Plaintiff was unable to enjoy the privileges and benefits  of the Website equally to sighted users.   27.  Many pages on the Website also contain the same title elements. This was a  problem for Plaintiff because in certain instances the screen reader failed to  distinguish one page from another. In order to fix this problem, Defendant must  change the title elements for each page.    28.  The Website also contains a host of broken links, which is a hyperlink to a non- existent or empty webpage. For the visually impaired this is especially paralyzing  due to the inability to navigate or otherwise determine where one is on the website  once a broken link is encountered. For example, upon coming across a link of  interest, Plaintiff was redirected to an error page. However, the screen-reader failed  to communicate that the link was broken. As a result, Plaintiff could not get back  to his original search.   29.  These access barriers effectively denied Plaintiff the ability to use and enjoy  Defendant’s website the same way sighted individuals do.    31.  Due to the inaccessibility of Defendant’s Website, blind and visually-impaired  customers such as Plaintiff, who need screen-readers, cannot fully and equally use  or enjoy the facilities, products, and services Defendant offers to the public on its  Website. The access barriers Plaintiff encountered have caused a denial of  Plaintiff’s full and equal access in the past, and now deter Plaintiff on a regular  basis from visiting the Website, presently and in the future.     32.  If the Website were equally accessible to all, Plaintiff could independently navigate  the Website and complete a desired transaction as sighted individuals do.   33.  Through his attempts to use the Website, Plaintiff has actual knowledge of the  access barriers that make these services inaccessible and independently unusable  by blind and visually-impaired people.   35.  Defendant therefore uses standards, criteria or methods of administration that have the  effect of discriminating or perpetuating the discrimination of others, as alleged herein.   36.  The ADA expressly contemplates the injunctive relief that Plaintiff seeks in this  action. In relevant part, the ADA requires:  In the case of violations of . . . this title, injunctive relief shall include an order to  alter facilities to make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals  with disabilities . . . Where appropriate, injunctive relief shall also include requiring  the . . . modification of a policy . . .  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(2).   38.  Web-based technologies have features and content that are modified on a daily, and   in some instances, an hourly, basis, and a one time “fix” to an inaccessible website  will not cause the website to remain accessible without a corresponding change in  corporate policies related to those web-based technologies. To evaluate whether an  inaccessible website has been rendered accessible, and whether corporate policies  related to web-based technologies have been changed in a meaningful manner that  will cause the website to remain accessible, the website must be reviewed on a  periodic basis using both automated accessibility screening tools and end user  testing by disabled individuals.   39.  Although Defendant may currently have centralized policies regarding maintaining  and operating its Website, Defendant lacks a plan and policy reasonably calculated  to make them fully and equally accessible to, and independently usable by, blind  and other visually-impaired consumers.    41.  Without injunctive relief, Plaintiff and other visually-impaired consumers will  continue to be unable to independently use the Website, violating their rights.  42.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, seeks to certify a  nationwide class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind  individuals in the United States who have attempted to access Defendant’s Website  and as a result have been denied access to the equal enjoyment of goods and services,  during the relevant statutory period.   43.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, seeks certify a New  York City subclass under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind  individuals in the City of New York who have attempted to access Defendant’s  Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal enjoyment of goods and  services offered, during the relevant statutory period.    45.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the Class. The Class, similarly to the Plaintiff, are  severely visually impaired or otherwise blind, and claim that Defendant has  violated the ADA or NYCHRL by failing to update or remove access barriers on  its Website so either can be independently accessible to the Class.   46.  Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the Class  Members because Plaintiff has retained and is represented by counsel competent  and experienced in complex class action litigation, and because Plaintiff has no  interests antagonistic to the Class Members. Class certification of the claims is  appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because Defendant has acted or refused  to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, making appropriate both  declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiff and the Class as a whole.   47.  Alternatively, class certification is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) because  fact and legal questions common to Class Members predominate over questions  affecting only individual Class Members, and because a class action is superior to  other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this litigation.   48.  Judicial economy will be served by maintaining this lawsuit as a class action in that  it is likely to avoid the burden that would be otherwise placed upon the judicial  system by the filing of numerous similar suits by people with visual disabilities  throughout the United States.  49.   Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the Class Members, repeats and realleges every  allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   50.  Section 302(a) of Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., provides:  No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and  equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or  accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,  leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.  42 U.S.C. § 12182(a).   51.  Defendant’s Website is a public accommodations within the definition of Title III  of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7). The Website is a service that is offered to the  general public, and as such, must be equally accessible to all potential consumers.   52.  Under Section 302(b)(1) of Title III of the ADA, it is unlawful discrimination to  deny individuals with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or benefit from  the products, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of an  entity. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i).   53.  Under Section 302(b)(1) of Title III of the ADA, it is unlawful discrimination to  deny individuals with disabilities an opportunity to participate in or benefit from  the products, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodation, which  is equal to the opportunities afforded to other individuals. 42 U.S.C. §  12182(b)(1)(A)(ii).   55.  The acts alleged herein constitute violations of Title III of the ADA, and the  regulations promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff, who is a member of a protected class  of persons under the ADA, has a physical disability that substantially limits the  major life activity of sight within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(1)(A)-(2)(A).  Furthermore, Plaintiff has been denied full and equal access to the Website, has not  been provided services that are provided to other patrons who are not disabled, and  has been provided services that are inferior to the services provided to non-disabled  persons. Defendant has failed to take any prompt and equitable steps to remedy its  discriminatory conduct. These violations are ongoing.   56.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 12188 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth and  incorporated therein, Plaintiff, requests relief as set forth below.  57.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the New York City Sub-Class Members, repeats  and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   59.  Defendant’s Website is a sales establishment and public accommodations within  the definition of N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(9).   60.  Defendant is subject to NYCHRL because it owns and operates its Website, making  it a person within the meaning of N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(1).   61.  Defendant is violating N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-107(4)(a) in refusing to  update or remove access barriers to Website, causing its Website and the services  integrated with such Website to be completely inaccessible to the blind. This  inaccessibility denies blind patrons full and equal access to the facilities, products,  and services that Defendant makes available to the non-disabled public.   62.  Defendant is required to “make reasonable accommodation to the needs of persons  with disabilities . . . any person prohibited by the provisions of [§ 8-107 et seq.]  from discriminating on the basis of disability shall make reasonable  accommodation to enable a person with a disability to . . . enjoy the right or rights  in question provided that the disability is known or should have been known by the  covered entity.” N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(15)(a).   64.  Defendant has failed to take any prompt and equitable steps to remedy their  discriminatory conduct. These violations are ongoing.   65.  As such, Defendant discriminates, and will continue in the future to discriminate  against Plaintiff and members of the proposed class and subclass on the basis of  disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the products, services, facilities,  privileges, advantages, accommodations and/or opportunities of its Website under  § 8-107(4)(a) and/or its implementing regulations. Unless the Court enjoins  Defendant from continuing to engage in these unlawful practices, Plaintiff and  members of the class will continue to suffer irreparable harm.   66.  Defendant’s actions were and are in violation of the NYCHRL and therefore  Plaintiff invokes his right to injunctive relief to remedy the discrimination.   67.  Plaintiff is also entitled to compensatory damages, as well as civil penalties and  fines under N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-120(8) and § 8-126(a) for each offense  as well as punitive damages pursuant to § 8-502.   68.  Plaintiff is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.   69.  Under N.Y.C. Administrative Code § 8-120 and § 8-126 and the remedies,  procedures, and rights set forth and incorporated therein Plaintiff prays for  judgment as set forth below.  70.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the Class and New York City Sub-Classes  Members, repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if  fully set forth herein.   71.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the parties in that Plaintiff  contends, and is informed and believes that Defendant denies, that its Website  contains access barriers denying blind customers the full and equal access to the  products, services and facilities of its Website, which Defendant owns, operations  and controls, fails to comply with applicable laws including, but not limited to, Title  III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182, et seq., and N.Y.C.  Admin. Code § 8-107, et seq. prohibiting discrimination against the blind.   72.  A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that each of  the parties may know their respective rights and duties and act accordingly.  VIOLATIONS OF THE NYCHRL  \n",

      "16.  MRMC is a privately held entity that has more than 2,600 employees. MRMC bills  itself, through its various subsidiaries, as “an independent provider of marketing and distribution  of fuel oil, asphalt, sulfuric acid, diesel fuel and high-quality naphthenic lubricants. . . . MRMC’s  surface transportation capabilities include operating over 800 trucks and 1200 trailers across the  United States through its network of 25 truck terminals.”   17.  MRMC is headquartered at 4200 B Stone Rd., Kilgore, Texas 75662.    18.  MRMC is an S corporation. MRMC stock is not readily tradable on an established  securities market.   19.  MRMC adopted the Plan with an effective date of January 1, 2012.    20.  The Plan is a retirement plan governed by ERISA.   5   21.  The Plan is an individual account plan under which a separate individual account  is established for each participant.   22.  The Plan’s principal asset has been MRMC stock at all times since its inception.   23.  MRMC identifies the Plan as intended to be a leveraged employee stock ownership  plan, or “Leveraged ESOP.”   24.  MRMC is the sponsor of the Plan within the meaning of ERISA § 3(16)(B),  67.  Plaintiff incorporates the preceding paragraphs as though set forth herein.   68.  ERISA § 406(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1106(a)(1)(A), prohibits a plan fiduciary, here  Wilmington Trust, from causing a plan, here the Plan, to engage in a sale or exchange of any  property, here MRMC stock, with a party in interest, here the sellers in the ESOP Transaction,  including but not limited to, on information and belief, Ruben S. Martin III; Scott D. Martin;  CNRT, LLC; The Ruben S. Martin III Dynasty Trust; and/or MRMC.   69.  ERISA § 406(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. § 1106(a)(1)(B), prohibits Wilmington Trust  from causing the Plan to borrow money from parties in interest MRMC; CNRT, LLC; and The  Ruben S. Martin III Dynasty Trust.    70.  ERISA § 406(a)(1)(E), 29 U.S.C. § 1106(a)(1)(E), prohibits Wilmington Trust  from causing the Plan to acquire MRMC securities.   71.  The stock and loan transactions between the Plan and the parties in interest were  authorized by Wilmington Trust in its capacity as Trustee for the Plan.   72.  Wilmington Trust caused the Plan to engage in prohibited transactions in violation  of ERISA § 406(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1106(a), in the ESOP Transaction.   73.  ERISA § 406(b), 29 U.S.C. § 1106(b), inter alia, mandates that a plan fiduciary  shall not “act in any transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party (or represent a party) whose  interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests of its participants,” or “receive any  consideration for his own personal account from any party dealing with such plan in connection  with a transaction involving the assets of the plan.”  12   74.  Wilmington Trust acted on behalf of the sellers in connection with the Plan’s stock  and loan transactions in 2012–2013 by causing the Plan to acquire MRMC stock and loans. This  greatly benefited the sellers to the substantial detriment of the Plan, even though Wilmington Trust  was required to serve the interests of the Plan in connection with any such transaction.   75.  Wilmington Trust received compensation from MRMC as Trustee for the Plan in  violation of ERISA § 406(b)(3).   76.  Wilmington Trust caused and engaged in prohibited transactions in violation of  ERISA § 406(b) in the ESOP Transaction.   77.  ERISA § 409, 29 U.S.C. § 1109, provides, inter alia, that any person who is a  fiduciary with respect to a plan and who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties  imposed on fiduciaries by Title I of ERISA shall be personally liable to make good to the plan any  losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and additionally is subject to such other  equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of the fiduciary.   78.  ERISA § 502(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), permits a plan participant to bring a suit for  relief under ERISA § 409 and to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce the provisions of  Title I of ERISA or to enforce the terms of a plan.   79.  Wilmington Trust has caused millions of dollars of losses to the Plan by the  prohibited transactions in an amount to be proven more specifically at trial.  80.  Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and  (b), on behalf of the following class:  All participants in the MRMC ESOP. Excluded from the Class are  the shareholders and entities controlled by them who sold their  Martin Resource Management Corporation (MRMC) stock to the  Plan and their immediate families; the directors of MRMC; and legal  13  representatives, successors, and assigns of any such excluded  persons.   81.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Although  the exact number and identities of Class members are unknown to Plaintiff at this time, the Plan’s  Form 5500 filing for 2015 indicates that as of December 31, 2015, there were 2,470 participants  and deceased participants whose beneficiaries are receiving or entitled to receive benefits in the  Plan.   82.  Questions of law and fact common to the Class as a whole include, but are not  limited to, the following:  i. Whether Wilmington Trust served as Trustee in the Plan’s acquisition of  MRMC stock;  ii. Whether Wilmington Trust was an ERISA fiduciary of the Plan;  iii. Whether Wilmington Trust caused the Plan to engage in prohibited  transactions under ERISA by permitting the Plan to purchase MRMC stock  and take loans from parties in interest;  iv. Whether Wilmington Trust engaged in good faith valuations of the MRMC  stock in connection with the ESOP Transaction;  v. Whether Wilmington Trust caused the Plan to pay more than fair market  value for MRMC stock;   vi. Whether Wilmington Trust engaged in a prohibited transaction under  ERISA by acting on behalf of a party adverse to the Plan and its participants  in the ESOP Transaction;  14  vii. Whether Wilmington Trust engaged in a prohibited transaction under  ERISA by receiving consideration for its own account in the ESOP  Transaction;  viii. Whether the sellers of MRMC stock to the Plan were parties in interest; and   ix. The amount of losses suffered by the Plan and its participants as a result of  Wilmington Trust’s ERISA violations.   83.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical of those of the Class. For example, Plaintiff, like other  Plan participants in the Class, suffered a diminution in the value of his Plan account because the  Plan paid an inflated price or prices and took on excessive loans for MRMC stock, and he continues  to suffer such losses in the present because Wilmington Trust failed to correct the overpayment by  the Plan in its time as Trustee.   84.  Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff has retained counsel competent and experienced in complex class actions, ERISA, and  employee benefits litigation.   85.  Class certification of Plaintiff’s Claims for Relief for the alleged violations of  ERISA is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) because the prosecution of separate  actions by individual Class members would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications  which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for Wilmington Trust, and/or because  adjudications with respect to individual Class members would as a practical matter be dispositive  of the interests of non-party Class members.   86.  In the alternative, class certification of Plaintiff’s Claims for Relief for the alleged  violations of ERISA is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because Wilmington Trust  has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, making appropriate  15  declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiff and the Class as a whole. The members  of the Class are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy Wilmington Trust’s  violations of ERISA.   87.  The names and addresses of the Class members are available from the Plan. Notice  will be provided to all members of the Class to the extent required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  Causing and Engaging in Prohibited Transactions Forbidden by   ERISA § 406(a)–(b), 29 U.S.C. § 1106(a)–(b)  \n",

      "53.  Plaintiff brings this case as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23,  on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.   54.  Plaintiff brings this case on behalf of the Class defined as follows:  No Consent Class: All persons in the United States  who, within four years prior to the filing of this  action, (1) were sent a text message by or on behalf  of Defendant, (2) using an automatic telephone  dialing system, (3) for the purpose of soliciting  Defendant’s goods and services, (4) without prior  express consent of the recipient, or with the same  manner of purported consent Defendant claims to  have obtained from Plaintiff, if any.   55.  Defendant and its employees or agents are excluded from the Class.  Plaintiff does not know the number of members in the Class but believes the Class  members number in the several thousands, if not more.  58.  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to members of  the Class which predominate over any questions affecting only individual members of  the Class.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the members of the Class  are:  a) Whether Defendant made non-emergency calls to Plaintiff’s and Class  members’ cellular telephones using an ATDS;  b) Whether Defendant can meet its burden of showing that it obtained  prior express written consent to make such calls;  c) Whether Defendant’s conduct was knowing and willful;  d) Whether Defendant is liable for damages, and the amount of such  damages; and  e) Whether Defendant should be enjoined from such conduct in the  future.   59.  The common questions in this case are capable of having common  answers. If Plaintiff’s claim that Defendant routinely transmits text messages to  telephone numbers assigned to cellular telephone services is accurate, Plaintiff and the  Class members will have identical claims capable of being efficiently adjudicated and  administered in this case.  64.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates the foregoing allegations as if fully set  forth herein.    65.  It is a violation of the TCPA to make “any call (other than a call made for  emergency purposes or made with the prior express consent of the called party) using  any automatic telephone dialing system … to any telephone number assigned to a …  cellular telephone service ….” 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii).    71.  Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates the allegations of paragraphs 1-63 as  if fully set forth herein.

      "13.  Defendant Pipeline Safety, L.L.C. is a pipeline services company that inspection,  safety, and document management services to pipeline companies.     14.  Plaintiff worked for Defendant as an NDE (Non-Destructive Examination) Auditor  from 2012 until 2016.   15.  Plaintiff worked for Defendant in multiple states for multiple clients, including in  Louisiana, Ohio, and New York.     16.  Plaintiff was responsible for performing visual inspections, non-destructive testing,  and X-ray verification of the welds on pipelines owned and operated by Defendant’s customers.     17.  Defendant classified Plaintiff as an employee.    18.  For his labor, Defendant paid Plaintiff a day rate but did not pay him overtime for  his hours in excess of forty per week.  In other words, Defendant misclassified Plaintiff as exempt.   19.  Plaintiff is a non-exempt employee.    20.  Defendant paid dozens of other auditors or inspectors classified as employees  throughout the United States on the same day rate compensation system as Plaintiff.   21.  Plaintiff and other auditors or inspectors commonly work in excess of 12 hours each  day.     23.  However, despite working overtime hours, Defendant does not pay its auditors or  inspectors overtime because it pays the same flat day rate regardless on the number of hours  worked.     24.  No exemption in the FLSA shelters Defendant from paying overtime to its auditors  or inspectors.   25.  Auditors or inspectors like Plaintiff are not guaranteed a set number of days to work  per week.   26.  Auditors or inspectors like Plaintiff are not guaranteed a set weekly payment.   27.  Auditors or inspectors are paid on a day rate basis, not on a salary basis.    28.  Plaintiff was paid on a day rate basis, not on a salary basis.    29.  Plaintiff was not paid time-and-a-half for all hours worked over forty in a given  workweek.    30.  Plaintiff worked overtime as defined in the FLSA.    31.  Other auditors or inspectors employed by Defendant worked overtime as defined  in the FLSA.    32.  Because auditors or inspectors are paid on a day rate, the executive, administrative,  or professional exemptions cannot apply.  See 29 C.F.R. §§ 541.100, 541.200, 541.300.      33.  Auditors or inspectors do not supervise other employees or manage a customarily  recognized department of Defendant’s company.   34.  Auditors or inspectors have no authority to hire or fire other employees.   36.  Auditors or inspectors also perform extensive physical labor to perform their  inspection work.   37.  The primary duty of an auditors or inspectors does not require independent  judgment or discretion.  Instead, auditors or inspectors are required to carry out their inspections  according to detailed step-by-step procedures promulgated by Defendant or Defendant’s  customers.   38.  The FLSA’s regulations even provide that inspection work is non-exempt work:  Ordinary inspection work generally does not meet the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption.  Inspectors normally  perform specialized work along standardized lines involving well- established techniques and procedures which may have been  catalogued and described in manuals and other sources.  Such  inspectors rely on techniques and skills acquired by special training  or experience.  They have some leeway in the performance of their  work but only within closely prescribed limits.  29 C.F.R. 541.203(g).     39.  Auditors or inspectors are not computer-systems analysts, computer programmers,  software engineers, or other similar employees.     40.  Despite these facts, Defendant misclassified its auditors or inspectors as exempt  from overtime pay.   41.  As a result of Defendant’s pay policies, Plaintiff and other auditors or inspectors  were denied overtime pay.   42.  Defendant knew, or showed reckless disregard for whether Plaintiff and the other  auditors or inspectors were entitled to overtime pay under the law.    44.   Defendant’s practice of failing to pay Plaintiff time-and-a-half for all hours worked  in excess of forty (40) per workweek violates the FLSA.  29 U.S.C. § 207.      45.   None of the exemptions provided by the FLSA regulating the duty of employers  to pay overtime at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which its employees  are paid are applicable to Defendant, Plaintiff, or the FLSA Class Members.    46.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs.   47.  Plaintiff has actual knowledge that FLSA Class Members have also been denied  overtime pay for hours worked over forty (40) hours in a workweek as a result of Defendant’s  misclassification of its employees.     48. Plaintiff’s knowledge is based on his personal work experience and through  communications with other workers of Defendant.  Plaintiff personally worked with other auditors  or inspectors under the same compensation structure at multiple job sites for Defendant.   49.  Other workers similarly situated to the Plaintiff worked for Defendant throughout  the United States, but were not paid overtime at the rate of one and one-half their regular rates of  pay when those hours exceeded forty (40) hours in a workweek.     50.  Although Defendant permitted and/or required FLSA Class Members to work in  excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek, Defendant denied them full compensation for their hours  worked over forty (40).   51.  Defendant misclassified and continues to misclassify FLSA Class Members as  exempt employees.     53.  Plaintiff had the same job duties as other employees of Defendant who had the same  job title as Plaintiff and worked for Defendant at any time during the three years prior to the filing  of this lawsuit.    54.  FLSA Class Members are not exempt from receiving overtime pay under the FLSA.   55.  As such, FLSA Class Members are similar to Plaintiff in terms of relevant job  duties, pay structure, misclassification as exempt employees and/or the denial of overtime pay.   56.  Defendant’s failure to pay overtime compensation at the rate required by the FLSA  results from generally applicable policies or practices, and does not depend on the personal  circumstances of any FLSA Class Member.   57.  Defendant employed at least 20 other auditors or inspectors within the last 3 years  who were paid on a day rate.    58.  Defendant employed at least 100 other auditors or inspectors within the last 3 years  who were paid on a day rate.    59.  Defendant employed at least 40 other employees with the same job title as Plaintiff  who were not paid overtime.    60.  Defendant employed at least 50 other employees with the same job title as Plaintiff  who worked overtime for at least one week during their employment with Defendant and were not  paid one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all overtime hours worked.    61.  The experiences of Plaintiff, with respect to his pay, hours, and duties are typical  of the experiences of the FLSA Class Members.   63.  All FLSA Class Members, irrespective of their particular job requirements, are  entitled to overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of forty (40) in a workweek.   64.  Although the exact amount of damages may vary among the FLSA Class Members,  the damages for the FLSA Class Members can be easily calculated by a simple formula. The claims  of all FLSA Class Members arise from a common nucleus of facts.  Liability is based on a  systematic course of wrongful conduct by Defendant that caused harm to all FLSA Class Members.    65.  As such, the class of similarly situated Plaintiffs for the FLSA Class is properly  defined as follows:   All current and former auditors or inspectors, and all employees  with substantially similar duties, who worked for Defendant at any  time during the three-year period before the filing of this Complaint  to present that were paid a day rate.     \n",

      "37.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their behalf and as a class action pursuant to Rules  23(a) & (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of all persons or entities who  purchased any “investment” offered by Defendants from May 6, 2006 until the present day (the  “Class Period”) and who suffered damages as a result (the “Class”).   38.  Excluded from the Class are: a. Defendants; b. members of the immediate family  of each of the Defendants that are not corporate entities; c. any person who was an executive  officer, employee and/or director of any Defendant during the Class Period; d. any person, firm,  trust, corporation, officer, director or any other individual or entity in which any Defendant has a  controlling interest or which is affiliated with any of the Defendants; e. any independent  contractor of any Defendants who participated in the sales of the investment  vehicles outlined  herein; and f. the legal representatives, agents, affiliates, heirs, successors-in-interest or assigns  of any such excluded party.   40.  Plaintiffs‟ claims are typical of the claims of members of the Class. Plaintiffs and  all members of the Class sustained damages as a result of the Defendants‟ unlawful course of  conduct including racketeering, money laundering, fraud, negligence, conversion, breach of  fiduciary duty, and fraud and other malfeasance as specified herein.   41.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the members of the  Class and has retained counsel competent and experienced in class action litigation. Plaintiffs  have no interests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the members of the Class that  Plaintiffs seek to represent.   42.   A class action is superior to other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication  of this controversy. The damages suffered by individual Class members may be relatively small,  some as little as $5,000; therefore the expense and burden of individual litigation make it  virtually impossible for the Class members individually to seek redress for the wrongful conduct  alleged herein.   44.   Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of  this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action.   45.   The names and addresses of the Defendants‟ customers and investors who  purchased “investments”  during the Class Period are obtainable from information in the  possession of the Defendants and/or their agents. Notice can be provided to such owners via first  class mail or email using techniques and a form of notice similar to those customarily used in  class actions.  46.  TAYLOR has always claimed to come from humble beginnings and bragged that  he started working at 12 and became a millionaire at the ripe old age of 16.  Then he “retired”  with his “vast fortune” but became “bored” and came back to work in 2000.   47.   Beginning in 2000,TAYLOR started touting himself to the public as a “self-made  millionaire at 16” by claiming that in 1998 he launched a company with a high school partner  called GoFerretGo.com that became a multi-million dollar company.     49.   TAYLOR repeatedly claimed in books, newspapers, television interviews,  emails, radio ads and You Tube videos that GoFerretGo.com had a value of $3.5 million at some  point during its less than 3 year history.   However, GoFerretGo.com mysteriously dissolved in  2001.   50.  TAYLOR tirelessly told the GoFerretGo.com story to potential investors, news  and TV reporters, church members, politicians, community leaders, etc. over many years in order  to garner their trust and gain access to other potential investors, who would be introduced to  TAYLOR through trusted members of their community, i.e., church leaders and pastors,  politicians, philanthropic leaders, etc.   51.  In 2004, Defendant TAYLOR formed Christian Capital Group, LLC (“Christian  Capital”), a Missouri limited liability company.  Defendant TAYLOR was the “executive  trustee” of Christian Capital. Throughout his meteoric rise to fame, TAYLOR always went back  to his roots, scamming mainly African-American and minority persons of faith with his  investment schemes.   52.  TAYLOR targeted minority and African American persons of faith because he  knew that there was an unwritten (and sometimes written) tenet imposed upon church members,  particularly in African-American and Christian churches, which can best be described as “what  happens in church stays in church.” The tenets of many Christian religions require disputes  among church members to be handled by the church through its Elders, Deacons and Minister  (assuming the Minister is not involved).     54.  TAYLOR was a master at using verbal constructions to describe the investment  “opportunities” he was hawking so that they sounded extremely impressive but actually were  meaningless. TAYLOR used his confidence trick to take advantage of his targets‟ lack of  investment knowledge. TAYLOR served as a “hub” for the victims recruiting and interacting  with them directly in order to perpetuate the scheme.   55.  The Ponzi schemes orchestrated by the CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS were  particularly well planned because the “investments” of the Plaintiffs and other Class members  were set up to automatically renew or “rollover” each year such that the investors could not  liquidate their investments automatically at the end of the investment period and, in fact, were  not even notified at the end of any investment period that they could withdraw their investment  funds or” choose” to reinvest; the interest that purportedly was being earned on the investment  “appeared” in the investors/victims‟ self-directed IRA accounts at EQUITY TRUST  automatically and regardless of whether the accrued interest had actually been placed in the  account.  (It had not for the majority of investors/victims).     56.  The CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS kept sending out investment account  statements and providing information to investors/victims showing the CITY CAPITAL  investors/victims the extraordinary investment returns they were earning by keeping their money  in their EQUITY TRUST self-directed IRA account thus maintaining the deception that the  schemes of the CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS were providing high returns.    58.  Investors conned by the CITY CAPITAL CONSPIRATORS would reinvest their  money in these schemes because they appeared to pay a much better return than any alternative  investment opportunity. At least the returns appeared much better according to their EQUITY  TRUST account statements.   59.   According to a press release issued by a Missouri entity called ”Christian  Capital” and TAYLOR, Christian Capital was a non-profit ministry “that employs biblical  principles to help individuals increase their financial resources through low-risk investment  opportunities.” (Ex. A). TAYLOR frequently reminded his targets that these were “once in a  lifetime” opportunities and that the potential investor needed to move fast or lose their place in  line for this investment “opportunity.”    60.   TAYLOR in 2004 made investment presentations for the “Prosperity Fund” a/k/a  Prosperity Ministries run by Christian Capital at minority and African-American churches in  Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.  (Ex. A).     61.  Taylor at times referred to himself as a “Minister” and an “ordained Minister.”   62.  Upon information and belief, TAYLOR never had any formal seminary training  nor had he ever been the minister or leader of a church.    64.   Defendant TAYLOR advertised that participation through investment in the  Prosperity Fund would help participants, many of whom were church-goers who heard  TAYLOR speak at their church, learn about how to: “eliminate consumer debt without  consolidation or refinancing; retire in 10 years or less; and be a part of a low-risk investment  with high performances” which were also “beneficial to the financial success of the church and  community.” (Ex. B).     65.  TAYLOR told the potential Prosperity Fund investors that God had helped him  find the perfect investment opportunity for the church and its members. This investment scam by  TAYLOR was a prelude to the Socially Conscious Investment Ponzi Scam of which Plaintiffs  and other Class members are victims, as discussed below.   66.  In September of 2004, TAYLOR was sued for fraud in the case of Williford et al  v. Ephren Taylor, Jr. (“Williford Complaint”) in Missouri both personally and as trustee of the  Prosperity Ministries trust.  Also named as defendants in the suit were his wife, Meshelle Taylor,  his father, (also named Ephren Taylor) and his father‟s church, Johnson County Church of Christ  (“Johnson County Church”).  (Ex. C).    67.  After this set back, rather than give up on his scams, TAYLOR decided to go  bigger.   69.   TAYLOR started holding himself out to the public in books, newspapers,  television, emails, radio ads and videos as a successful businessman overseeing $250 million  dollars in assets of two publicly traded companies.   70.  An essential part of TAYLOR‟S scam, as with other Ponzi schemes, was and is to  make investors want to invest in him via his wildly successful “companies.”  While some of  TAYLOR‟S investment success “stories” and personal financial dealings may have been real, the  majority of them were purely fabricated.    71.  Upon information and belief, Defendants BRANTLEY, WEB3 and MCCARTHY  were instrumental in helping TAYLOR create the fictional character that TAYLOR assumed and  which permitted him to bilk millions of dollars from hundreds or thousands of investors.   72.  Through numerous press releases and hundreds of speaking engagements, books,  blogs, You Tube videos, radio and television commercials and interviews and public  appearances, TAYLOR convinced the world that he was a “Minister,” financial guru, investment  wizard, multi- million dollar business manager and philanthropic rock star.   73.   A Ponzi scheme or fraudulent enterprise cannot be successful or even operate  without the help of a number of individuals both inside and outside the company perpetuating the  scheme.  The facts will show that TAYLOR was part of a carefully orchestrated con-not a solo  act.     A.  THE CREATION OF EPHREN TAYLOR'S IMAGE    CONSPIRACY  (against all Defendants)  502.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege herein paragraphs 1-503 above as  if fully set forth herein.  503.  At all relevant times, all Defendants joined in a common effort to commit the  tortuous conduct and violations of state and federal law alleged in this complaint.  504.  Defendants made their fraudulent misstatements and committed fraud as alleged  above in part in order to induce Plaintiffs and the other Class members to invest in CITY  MONEY LAUNDERING  (Against all Defendants)  451.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege herein paragraphs 1-450 above as  if fully set forth herein.  452.   Further, as part of Defendants‟ operation of the Socially Conscious Investment  Ponzi Scam and the Sweeps Machine Investment Ponzi Scam, they engaged in, and otherwise  caused, numerous financial transactions and transfers through financial institutions in the United  States, which transactions violated 18 U.S.C. Sections 1956 and 1957.  453.  Defendants committed acts of money laundering, namely financial transactions, to  promote their unlawful misappropriation of investor funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1956  (a) (1) (A) and to conceal their unlawful activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1956 (a) (1)  VIOLATION OF NORTH CAROLINA SECURITIES ACT  Chapter 78A-10  (Against all Defendants)   542. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege herein paragraphs 1-541 above as  if fully set forth herein.  543.  The acts and practices of the Defendants alleged herein violated Chapter 78A-10  of the North Carolina Securities Act, in that Defendants made, or caused to be made,  representations or statements which were false, where (i) they knew the truth, or (ii) with  reasonable efforts could have known the truth, or (iii) made no reasonable effort to ascertain the  truth, or (iv) did not have knowledge concerning the representations or statements made, where  said representations or statements were engaged in to induce or promote the issuance,  distribution, exchange, sale, negotiation, or purchase within or from this state of securities.  VIOLATION OF NORTH CAROLINA SECURITIES ACT Chapter 78A-11  (Against all  Defendants)  546.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege paragraphs 1 through 545 above as if fully incorporated  herein.    547.  The acts and practices of the Defendants alleged herein violated Chapter 78A-11 of  the North Carolina Securities Act, in that they involved the use or employment of a fraud, deception,  concealment, suppression, or false pretense, where said uses or employments were engaged in to  induce or promote the issuance, distribution, exchange, sale, negotiation, or purchase within or from  this state of securities by the use of unlawful telephone rooms in violation of Chapter 78A-11. \n",

      "10.  According to its website, Execu|Search has placed 62,000 people in new jobs for  27,000 companies.  As such, it is reasonable that there would be at least 50 members in each  Class.    11.  The group of potential Class members is so numerous as to make it impracticable  to bring them all before the Court, for which reason Mr. Garcia initiates this litigation for all  persons similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23.   12.  Despite the numerical size of the Classes, the identities of Class members can be  ascertained through Execu|Search’s records.   13.  Mr. Garcia and his counsel do not anticipate any difficulties in the management of  this action as a class action.   14.  Mr. Garcia is committed to vigorous prosecution of this action, will adequately  represent the purported Class members in this action, and has retained competent counsel  experienced in class action litigation.   15.  Mr. Garcia is a member of Class 1 and Class 2 and has no interest antagonistic to  or in conflict with other Class members.   17.  Mr. Garcia’s claims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses of the Class  Members.   18.  Mr. Garcia has the same interests as other Class members in prosecuting his  claims against Execu|Search.   19.  Mr. Garcia and all Class members sustained damages as a result of  Execu|Search’s wrongful conduct.    20.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient  adjudication of this controversy.    21.  Furthermore, due to the expense and burden of individual litigation, it would be  extraordinarily difficult for Class members to redress the wrongs done to them individually.   23.  Mr. Garcia is an experienced information technology (IT) professional with over a  decade of experience in a wide range of technical applications and programming languages.     24.  In and around September 2017, Bryant Vargas, a recruiter at Execu|Search,  contacted Mr. Garcia about an open IT Trainer position at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital  55.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and those similarly situated, hereby realleges and  incorporates each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 54 with the same force  as though separately alleged herein.   56.  Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681(b)(3)(A), before taking an adverse employment action  against a job applicant based on a consumer report, the employer must provide the applicant with  a copy of their consumer report.   58.  For this violation, Mr. Garcia and the putative Class 1 members are entitled to the  greater of their actual damages or statutory damages up to $1,000.  59.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and those similarly situated, hereby realleges and  incorporates each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 58 with the same force  as though separately alleged herein.   60.  Under 15 U.S.C. § 1681(b)(3)(A), before taking an adverse employment action  against a job applicant based on a consumer report, the employer must provide the applicant with  a description in writing of their rights under the FCRA.   61.  Here, Execu|Search did not provide Mr. Garcia and the putative Class 2 members  with descriptions in writing of their rights under the FCRA prior to taking adverse employment  actions against them, in violation of the FCRA.     9.  While the exact number of Class members is presently unknown, it is estimated  that there are at least 50 Class members in Class 1 and at least 50 Class members in Class 2.

      "20.  NYX’s Website is heavily integrated with its physical stores, serving as a  gateway to those brick and mortar locations. Through the Website, NYX customers are,  inter alia, able to: find information about the stores’ locations and hours of operation;  purchase makeup and makeup accessories (e.g., lipstick, lipgloss, bronzer, blush,  eyeliner, brushes) and learn about those products (e.g., learn “what’s trending,” best  sellers, “fan faves”); purchase a gift card; learn about and access special offers and sales  (e.g., discounts, special mark downs); learn style tips; and learn about the company’s  refund policies.   21.  It is, upon information and belief, NYX’s policy and practice to deny  Plaintiff Young and other blind or visually-impaired users access to its Website, thereby  denying the goods and services that are offered and integrated with NYX’s stores. Due to  NYX’s failure and refusal to remove access barriers to its Website, Plaintiff Young and  visually-impaired persons have been and are still being denied equal access to NYX’s  stores and the numerous goods, services, and benefits offered to the public through the  Website.    22.  Plaintiff Young cannot use a computer without the assistance of screen- reading software. He is, however, a proficient JAWS screen-reader user and uses it to  access the Internet. He has visited the Website on separate occasions using the JAWS  screen-reader.    25.  Due to the inaccessibility of its Website, blind and visually-impaired  customers such as Plaintiff Young, who need screen-readers, cannot fully and equally use  or enjoy the facilities, goods, and services NYX offer to the public on its Website. The  Website’s access barriers that Plaintiff Young encountered have caused a denial of his  full and equal access in the past, and now deter him on a regular basis from accessing the  Website. These access barriers have likewise deterred him from visiting NYX’s physical  stores and enjoying them equal to sighted individuals.   26.  If the Website was equally accessible to all, Plaintiff Young could  independently navigate it and complete a desired transaction as sighted individuals do.   27.  Through his attempts to use the Website, Plaintiff Young has actual  knowledge of the access barriers that make these services inaccessible and independently  unusable by blind and visually-impaired people.   29.  NYX therefore uses standards, criteria or methods of administration that  have the effect of discriminating or perpetuating the discrimination of others, as alleged  herein.   30.  Title III of the ADA expressly contemplates the injunctive relief that  Plaintiff seeks:  In the case of violations of . . . this title, injunctive relief shall include an  order to alter facilities to make such facilities readily accessible to and  usable by individuals with disabilities . . . Where appropriate, injunctive  relief shall also include requiring the . . . modification of a policy . . .  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(2).   32.  Although NYX may currently have centralized policies regarding  maintaining and operating its Website, NYX lacks a plan and policy reasonably  calculated to make them fully and equally accessible to, and independently usable by,  blind and other visually impaired consumers.   33.  Without injunctive relief, Plaintiff Young and other visually impaired  consumers will continue to be unable to independently use the Website, violating its  rights.   34.  NYX has, upon information and belief, invested substantial sums in  developing and maintaining its Website and has generated significant revenue from the  Website. These amounts are far greater than the associated cost of making its Website  equally accessible to visually impaired customers.   36.  Plaintiff Young seeks to certify a nationwide class under Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind individuals in the United States who have attempted  to access NYX’s Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal enjoyment  of goods and services offered in NYX’s physical locations, during the relevant statutory  period (“Class Members”).   37.  Plaintiff Young seeks to certify a State of New York subclass under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind individuals in the State of New York who  have attempted to access the Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal  enjoyment of goods and services offered in NYX’s physical locations, during the relevant  statutory period (“New York Subclass Members”).   38.  Plaintiff Young seeks to certify a New York City subclass under Fed. R.  Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2): all legally blind individuals in the City of New York who have  attempted to access the Website and as a result have been denied access to the equal  enjoyment of goods and services offered in NYX’s physical locations, during the relevant  statutory period (“New York City Subclass Members”).   40.  Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the Class Members, New York Subclass  Members and New York City Subclass Members: they are all severely visually impaired  or otherwise blind, and claim that NYX has violated Title III of the ADA, NYSHRL or  NYCHRL by failing to update or remove access barriers on its Website so it can be  independently accessible to the visually impaired individuals.   41.  Plaintiff Young will fairly and adequately represent and protect the Class  and Subclasses’ interests because he has retained and is represented by counsel  competent and experienced in complex class action litigation, and because he has no  interests antagonistic to the Class or Subclasses. Class certification of the claims is  appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because NYX has acted or refused to act on  grounds generally applicable to the Class and Subclasses, making appropriate both  declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiff, the Class and Subclasses.   43.  Judicial economy will be served by maintaining this lawsuit as a class  action in that it is likely to avoid the burden that would be otherwise placed upon the  judicial system by the filing of numerous similar suits by people with visual disabilities  throughout the United States.  44.   Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf of the Class Members, repeats  and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   45.  Title III of the ADA prohibits “discriminat[ion] on the basis of disability  in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,  or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,  leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a).   46.  NYX’s stores are public accommodations within the definition of Title III  of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7). Its Website is a service, privilege, or advantage of  NYX’s stores. The Website is a service that is integrated with these locations.   47.  Under Title III of the ADA, it is unlawful discrimination to deny  individuals with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods,  services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of an entity. 42 U.S.C. §  12182(b)(1)(A)(i).   49.  Under Title III of the ADA, unlawful discrimination also includes, among  other things:  [A] failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or  procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods,  services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to  individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making  such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods,  services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations; and a  failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual  with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise  treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of  auxiliary aids and services, unless the entity can demonstrate that taking  such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the good, service,  facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation being offered or would  result in an undue burden.  42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).   50.  These acts alleged herein violate Title III of the ADA, and the regulations  promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff Young, who is a member of a protected class of  persons under Title III of the ADA, has a physical disability that substantially limits the  major life activity of sight within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(1)(A)-(2)(A).  Furthermore, he has been denied full and equal access to the Website, has not been  provided services that are provided to other patrons who are not disabled, and has been  provided services that are inferior to the services provided to non-disabled persons.    51.  Under 42 U.S.C. § 12188 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set  forth and incorporated therein, Plaintiff Young requests the relief as set forth below.  53.  N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(a) provides that it is “an unlawful discriminatory  practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent,  agent or employee of any place of public accommodation . . . because of the . . . disability  of any person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person any  of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof.”   54.  NYX’s physical locations are in the State of New York and throughout the  United States and constitute sales establishments and public accommodations within the  definition of N.Y. Exec. Law § 292(9). NYX’s Website is a service, privilege or  advantage of NYX. NYX’s Website is a service that is by and integrated with these  physical locations.   55.  NYX is subject to NYSHRL because it owns and operates its physical  locations and the Website. NYX is a “person” within the meaning of N.Y. Exec. Law §  292(1).   56.  NYX is violating N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(a) in refusing to update or  remove access barriers to its Website, causing its Website and the services integrated  with its physical locations to be completely inaccessible to the blind. This inaccessibility  denies blind patrons full and equal access to the facilities, goods and services that NYX  makes available to the non-disabled public.   58.  Under N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(c)(ii), unlawful discriminatory practice  also includes, “a refusal to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no  individual with a disability is excluded or denied services because of the absence of  auxiliary aids and services, unless such person can demonstrate that taking such steps  would fundamentally alter the nature of the facility, privilege, advantage or  accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden.”    59.  Readily available, well-established guidelines exist on the Internet for  making websites accessible to the blind and visually impaired. These guidelines have  been followed by other large business entities and government agencies in making their  websites accessible, including but not limited to: adding alt-text to graphics and ensuring  that all functions can be performed using a keyboard. Incorporating the basic components  to make its Website accessible would neither fundamentally alter the nature of its  business nor result in an undue burden to them.   61.  NYX discriminates, and will continue in the future to discriminate against  Plaintiff Young and New York Subclass Members on the basis of disability in the full  and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,  accommodations and/or opportunities of NYX’s Website and its physical locations under  § 296(2) et seq. and/or its implementing regulations. Unless the Court enjoins NYX from  continuing to engage in these unlawful practices, Plaintiff and the New York Subclass  Members will continue to suffer irreparable harm.   62.  As NYX’s actions violate the NYSHRL, Plaintiff Young seeks injunctive  relief to remedy the discrimination.   63.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to compensatory damages, as well as civil  penalties and fines under N.Y. Exec. Law § 297(4)(c) et seq. for every offense.   64.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.   65.  Under N.Y. Exec. Law § 297 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set  forth and incorporated therein Plaintiff prays for judgment as set forth below.  66.  Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf the New York Subclass  Members, repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully  set forth herein.   68.  N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 40 provides that “all persons within the  jurisdiction of this state shall be entitled to the full and equal accommodations,  advantages, facilities and privileges of any places of public accommodations, resort or  amusement, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and  applicable alike to all persons. No persons, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager,  superintendent, agent, or employee of any such place shall directly or indirectly refuse,  withhold from, or deny to any person any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities  and privileges thereof . . .”   69.  N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 40-c(2) provides that “no person because of . . .   disability, as such term is defined in section two hundred ninety-two of executive law, be  subjected to any discrimination in his or her civil rights, or to any harassment, as defined  in section 240.25 of the penal law, in the exercise thereof, by any other person or by any  firm, corporation or institution, or by the state or any agency or subdivision.”   70.  NYX’s New York City physical locations are sales establishments and  public accommodations within the definition of N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 40-c(2). NYX’s  Website is a service, privilege or advantage of NYX and its Website is a service that is by  and integrated with these establishments.   71.  NYX is subject to N.Y. Civ. Rights Law because it owns and operates its  physical locations and Website. NYX is a person within the meaning of N.Y. Civil Law §  40-c(2).   73.  N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 41 states that “any corporation which shall violate  any of the provisions of sections forty, forty-a, forty-b or forty two . . . shall for each and  every violation thereof be liable to a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars nor  more than five hundred dollars, to be recovered by the person aggrieved thereby . . .”   74.  Under N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 40-d, “any person who shall violate any of  the provisions of the foregoing section, or subdivision three of section 240.30 or section  240.31 of the penal law, or who shall aid or incite the violation of any of said provisions  shall for each and every violation thereof be liable to a penalty of not less than one  hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, to be recovered by the person  aggrieved thereby in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the  Defendants shall reside . . .”   75.  NYX discriminates, and will continue to discriminate against Plaintiff  Young and the New York Subclass Members on the basis of disability, as they are being  directly or indirectly refused, withheld from, or denied the accommodations, advantages,  facilities and privileges thereof in § 40 et seq. and/or its implementing regulations.   77.  Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf the New York City Subclass  Members, repeats and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully  set forth herein.   78.  The NYCHRL provides that “It shall be an unlawful discriminatory  practice for any person, being the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent,  agent or employee of any place or provider of public accommodation, because of . . .  disability . . . directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from or deny to such person, any  of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof.” N.Y.C. Admin.  Code § 8-107(4)(a).   79.  NYX’s locations are sales establishments and public accommodations  within the meaning of the NYCHRL, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(9), and its Website is  a service that is integrated with its establishments.   80.  NYX is subject to NYCHRL because it owns and operates its physical  locations in the City of New York and its Website, making it a person within the meaning  of N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-102(1).   81.  NYX is violating the NYCHRL in refusing to update or remove access  barriers to Website, causing its Website and the services integrated with its physical  locations to be completely inaccessible to the blind. This inaccessibility denies blind  patrons full and equal access to the facilities, goods, and services that NYX make  available to the non-disabled public.   83.  NYX’s actions constitute willful intentional discrimination against the  Subclass because of a disability, violating the NYCHRL, N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8- 107(4)(a) and § 8-107(15)(a,) in that it has:  a.  Constructed and maintained a website that is inaccessible to blind  class members with knowledge of the discrimination; and/or  b.  Constructed and maintained a website that is sufficiently intuitive  and/or obvious that is inaccessible to blind class members; and/or  c.  Failed to take actions to correct these access barriers in the face of  substantial harm and discrimination to blind class members.   84.  As such, NYX discriminates, and will continue in the future to  discriminate against Plaintiff and the New York City Subclass Members because of  disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,  advantages, accommodations and/or opportunities of its Website and its establishments  under § 8-107(4)(a) and/or its implementing regulations. Unless the Court enjoins NYX  from continuing to engage in these unlawful practices, Plaintiff and the New York City  Subclass will continue to suffer irreparable harm.   86.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to compensatory damages, as well as civil  penalties and fines for each offense. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §§ 8-120(8), 8-126(a).   87.  Plaintiff Young is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.   88.  Under N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-120 and § 8-126 and the remedies,  procedures, and rights set forth and incorporated therein Plaintiff prays for judgment as  set forth below.  89.  Plaintiff Young, individually and on behalf the Class Members, repeats  and realleges every allegation of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   90.  An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the parties in that  Plaintiff Young contends, and is informed and believes that NYX denies, that its Website  contains access barriers denying blind customers the full and equal access to the goods,  services and facilities of its Website and by extension its physical locations, which NYX  owns, operates and controls, fails to comply with applicable laws including, but not  limited to, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182, et seq.,  N.Y. Exec. Law § 296, et seq., and N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107, et seq. prohibiting  discrimination against the blind.   91.  A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate now in order that each  of the parties may know its respective rights and duties and act accordingly.

      "11. Plaintiff brings claims, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (hereinafter  “FRCP”) Rule 23, individually and on behalf of the following nationwide consumer class  (the “Class”):   All New York consumers who were sent collection letters and/or notice from  Defendant attempting to collect an obligation owed to or allegedly owed to  3  PayPal Inc., that contain at least one of the alleged violations arising from  Defendant's violation of 15 U.S.C. §1692 et seq..    The Class period begins one year to the filing of this Action.   13. The Class satisfies all the requirements of Rule 23 of the FRCP for maintaining a class  action:   Upon information and belief, the Class is so numerous that joinder of all  members is impracticable because there are hundreds and/or thousands of  persons who have received debt collection letters and/or notices from the  Defendant that violate specific provisions of the FDCPA. Plaintiff is  complaining of a standard form letter and/or notice that is sent to hundreds of  persons (See Exhibit A, except that the undersigned attorney has, in  accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2 partially redacted the financial account  numbers in an effort to protect Plaintiff’s privacy);   There are questions of law and fact which are common to the Class and which  predominate over questions affecting any individual Class member.  These  common questions of law and fact include, without limitation:  a.  Whether Defendant violated various provisions of the FDCPA;  b.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class have been injured by Defendant’s  conduct;  c.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class have sustained damages and are  entitled to restitution as a result of Defendant’s wrongdoing and if  so, what is the proper measure and appropriate statutory formula to  be applied in determining such damages and restitution; and  4  d.  Whether Plaintiff and the Class are entitled to declaratory and/or  injunctive relief.   Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the Class, which all arise from the same  operative facts and are based on the same legal theories.   Plaintiff has no interest adverse or antagonistic to the interest of the other  members of the Class.   Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the Class and has  retained experienced and competent attorneys to represent the Class.   A Class Action is superior to other methods for the fair and efficient  adjudication of the claims herein asserted. Plaintiff anticipates that no unusual  difficulties are likely to be encountered in the management of this class action.   A Class Action will permit large numbers of similarly situated persons to  prosecute their common claims in a single forum simultaneously and without  the duplication of effort and expense that numerous individual actions would  engender.  Class treatment will also permit the adjudication of relatively small  claims by many Class members who could not otherwise afford to seek legal  redress for the wrongs complained of herein.  Absent a Class Action, class  members will continue to suffer losses of statutory protected rights as well as  monetary damages. If Defendant’s conduct is allowed proceed to without  remedy they will continue to reap and retain the proceeds of their ill-gotten  gains.  5   Defendant has acted on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class,  thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding  declaratory relief with respect to the Class as a whole.  14. Plaintiff repeats, reiterates and incorporates the allegations contained in paragraphs  numbered “1” through “13” herein with the same force and effect as if the same were set  forth at length herein.   15. Some time prior to July 7, 2014, an obligation was allegedly incurred to PayPal, Inc.   16. The PayPal, Inc. obligation arose out of a transaction in which money, property,  insurance or services, which are the subject of the transaction, are primarily for personal,  family or household purposes.   17. The alleged PayPal, Inc. obligation is a \"debt\" as defined by 15 U.S.C.§ 1692a(5).   18. PayPal, Inc. is a \"creditor\" as defined by 15 U.S.C.§ 1692a(4).   19. Defendant contends that the PayPal, Inc. debt is past due.   20. Defendant collects and attempts to collect debts incurred or alleged to have been incurred  for personal, family or household purposes on behalf of creditors using the United States  Postal Services, telephone and internet.   21. PayPal, Inc. directly or through an intermediary contracted Defendant to collect the  alleged debt.   22. On or about July 7, 2014, the Defendant caused to be delivered to the Plaintiff a  collection letter in an attempt to collect the alleged debt. See Exhibit A.   23. The July 7, 2014 letter was sent or caused to be sent by persons employed by Defendant  as a “debt collector” as defined by 15 U.S.C. §1692a(6).  6   24. The July 7, 2014 letter is a “communication” as defined by 15 U.S.C. §1692a(2).   25. The July 7, 2014 letter stated in part;  “Because of interest, late charges, and other charges that may vary from day to  day, the amount due on the day you pay may be greater…..”   26. Upon information and belief, the Defendant will not increase the Plaintiff’s account due  to fees, late charges or other charges.   27. Defendant could have taken the steps necessary to bring its actions within compliance  with the FDCPA, but neglected to do so and failed to adequately review its actions to  ensure compliance with the law.   28. On information and belief, Defendant sent a written communication, in the form annexed  hereto as Exhibit A to at least 50 natural persons in the State of New York within one  year of the date of this Complaint.  29. Plaintiff repeats, reiterates and incorporates the allegations contained in paragraphs  numbered “1” through “28” herein with the same force and effect as if the same were set  forth at length herein.   30. Defendant’s debt collection efforts attempted and/or directed towards the Plaintiff  violated various provisions of the FDCPA, including but not limited to 15 U.S.C. §  1692e.   31. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1692e, a debt collector is prohibited from using false, deceptive,  or misleading representation in connection with the collection of a debt.  7   32. The Defendant violated 1692e by falsely suggesting that immediate payment of their  balance would benefit them financially by stating that the amount may change due to  interest or other charges that may be added after the date of the letter. As the amount  Defendant seeks to collect never varies from the date of issuance, and Defendant never  makes an adjustment after it receives payment in the amount of the initial letter, the  statement in its letter is false, deceptive and misleading.    33. By reason thereof, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for judgment that Defendant's conduct  violated Section 1692e et seq. of the FDCPA, actual damages, statutory damages, costs  and attorneys’ fees.  34. Plaintiff repeats, reiterates and incorporates the allegations contained in paragraphs  numbered “1” through “33” herein with the same force and effect as if the same were set  forth at length herein.   35. Pursuant to 15 USC §1692g, a debt collector:  (a) Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in  connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the  following information is contained in the initial communication or the  consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing –  (1) The amount of the debt;  (2) The name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;  (3) A statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of  the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt  will be assumed to be valid by the debt-collector;  (4) A statement that the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within  thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt  collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment  against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be  8  mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and  (5) A statement that, upon the consumer’s written request within the thirty- day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name  and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.   36. The Defendant further violated 1692g by failing to accurately state the balance of the  debt by stating that the outstanding balance may increase. Therefore, leaving the least  sophisticated consumer to reasonably conclude that he must pay the balance stated in the  letter immediately or possibly owe a larger amount, causing the consumer to be uncertain  of his rights.   37. By reason thereof, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for judgment that Defendant's conduct  violated Section 1692g et seq. of the FDCPA, actual damages, statutory damages, costs  and attorneys’ fees.

      "1. there is no explanation of the increase or note that the balance is increasing  or will continue to increase; or   11.  Plaintiff brings this claim on behalf of the following class, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.  P. 23(a) and 23(b)(3).   12.  The Class consists of:   a. all individuals with addresses in the State of New York;  b. to whom Defendant Simm sent a. initial letter;  c. attempting to collect a consumer debt;  d. where the current balance is listed as more than the charge-off balance;  e. in two sub-classes where:   13.  The identities of all class members are readily ascertainable from the records of  Defendant and those companies and entities on whose behalf it attempts to collect and/or has  purchased debts.   14.  Excluded from the Plaintiff Class are the Defendant and all officers, members,  partners, managers, directors and employees of the Defendant and their respective immediate  families, and legal counsel for all parties to this action, and all members of their immediate families.    15.  There are questions of law and fact common to the Plaintiff Class, which common  issues predominate over any issues involving only individual class members. The principal issue is  whether the Defendant’s written communication to consumers, in the forms attached as Exhibit A,  violate 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692e, 1692f, and 1692g.   16.  The Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the class members, as all are based upon the same  facts and legal theories. The Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Plaintiff  Class defined in this complaint. The Plaintiff has retained counsel with experience in handling  consumer lawsuits, complex legal issues, and class actions, and neither the Plaintiff nor her attorneys  have any interests, which might cause them not to vigorously pursue this action.   17.  This action has been brought, and may properly be maintained, as a class action  pursuant to the provisions of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because there is a well- defined community interest in the litigation:  a. Numerosity: The Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,  that the Plaintiff Class defined above is so numerous that joinder of all members  would be impractical.  b. Common Questions Predominate: Common questions of law and fact exist as  to all members of the Plaintiff Class and those questions predominance over any  questions or issues involving only individual class members. The principal issue  is whether the Defendant’s written communication to consumers, in the form  attached as Exhibit A, violate 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692e, 1692f, and 1692g.  c. Typicality: The Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the class members.  The Plaintiff and all members of the Plaintiff Class have claims arising out of the  Defendant’s common uniform course of conduct complained of herein.  d. Adequacy: The Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the  class members insofar as Plaintiff has no interests that are adverse to the absent  class members. Plaintiff is committed to vigorously litigating this matter.  Plaintiff has also retained counsel experienced in handling consumer lawsuits,  complex legal issues, and class actions. Neither the Plaintiff nor counsel have  any interests which might cause them not to vigorously pursue the instant class  action lawsuit.  e. Superiority: A class action is superior to the other available means for the fair  and efficient adjudication of this controversy because individual joinder of all  members would be impracticable. Class action treatment will permit a large  number of similarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims in a single  forum efficiently and without unnecessary duplication of effort and expense that  individual actions would engender.   18.  Certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  is also appropriate in that the questions of law and fact common to members of the Plaintiff Class  predominate over any questions affecting an individual member, and a class action is superior to  other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.   19.  Depending on the outcome of further investigation and discovery, Plaintiff may, at  the time of class certification motion, seek to certify a class(es) only as to particular issues pursuant  to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).  2.  where additional amounts that could be added or subtracted from the  balance since charge-off are all listed as zero; and  f. which letter was sent on or after a date one (1) year prior to the filing of this  action and on or before a date twenty-one (21) days after the filing of this action.   20.  Plaintiff repeats the above allegations as if set forth here.   21.  Some time prior to September 14, 2020, Plaintiff allegedly incurred an obligation to  non-party U.S. Bank.   22.  The obligation arose out of transactions incurred primarily for personal, family, or  household purposes, specifically a U.S. Bank personal loan.   23.  The alleged U.S. Bank obligation is a \"debt\" as defined by 15 U.S.C.§ 1692a (5).   24.  U.S. Bank is a \"creditor\" as defined by 15 U.S.C.§ 1692a (4).   25.  According to Defendant’s letter, U.S. Bank ‘listed’ Plaintiff’s account with  Defendant Simm for collection.   26.  Defendant Simm collects and attempts to collect debts incurred or alleged to have  been incurred for personal, family or household purposes on behalf of creditors using the United  States Postal Services, telephone and internet.  Violation - September 14, 2020 Collection Letter   27.  On or about September 14, 2020, Defendant Simm sent Plaintiff an initial collection  letter regarding the alleged debt.  See Letter attached as Exhibit A.   28.  The Letter states “BALANCE: $11,554.12” and then states:  61.  Plaintiff repeats the above allegations as if set forth here.   62.  Defendant’s debt collection efforts attempted and/or directed towards the Plaintiff  violated various provisions of the FDCPA, including but not limited to, 15 U.S.C. § 1692e.   63.  Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1692e, a debt collector may not use any deceptive, or  misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.   64.  Defendant violated said section by:   a. Failing to state that the balance may increase despite that it could, and in fact,  did; or alternatively, implying that it will continue to increase when in fact it  would not; in violation of §1692e (10); and  b. Stating zero amounts for additions to the charge-off amount despite that the  balance had increased, in violation of §1692e (10); and  c. Falsely representing the character, amount or legal status of the debt in violation  of §1692e (2).   65.  By reason thereof, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for judgment that Defendant’s  conduct violated Section 1692e, et seq. of the FDCPA and Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages,  statutory damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.  66.  Plaintiff repeats the above allegations as if set forth here.   67.  In the alternative, Defendant’s debt collection efforts attempted and/or directed  towards the Plaintiff violated various provisions of the FDCPA, including but not limited to, 15  U.S.C. § 1692f.   68.  Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1692f, a debt collector may not use any unfair or  unconscionable means in connection with the collection of any debt.   69.  Defendant violated this section by unfairly   a. failing to note that the balance may increase despite that it could, and in fact, did;  b. Failing to state that the balance may increase despite that it could, and in fact,  did; or alternatively, implying that it will continue to increase when in fact it  would not; and  c. Stating zero amounts for additions to the charge-off amount despite that the  balance had increased; and  d. Falsely representing the character, amount or legal status of the debt in violation.   70.  By reason thereof, Defendant are liable to Plaintiff for judgment that Defendant’s  conduct violated Section 1692f, et seq. of the FDCPA and Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages,  statutory damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.  71.  Plaintiff repeats the above allegations as if set forth here.   72.  Defendants’ debt collection efforts attempted and/or directed towards the Plaintiff  violated various provisions of the FDCPA, including but not limited to 15 U.S.C. § 1692g.   73.  Pursuant to 15 USC §1692g:  Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in  connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the  following information is contained in the initial communication or the  consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing -- (1) the amount of the debt   74.  Defendant violated 15 U.S.C. §1692g by failing to include a clear statement about  the amount of the debt and whether it is static or dynamic despite the implications in the letter.   75.  By reason thereof, Defendant are liable to Plaintiff for judgment that Defendants’  conduct violated Section 1692g et seq. of the FDCPA, actual damages, statutory damages, costs  and attorneys’ fees.

      "Defendants specialize in providing landscape and grounds keeping services, including construction services, for business and residential clients. Defendant Gregory Hamann has operational control over Prime Lawn Care Inc. and developed the scheme to underpay employees. Defendants employed approximately 80 hourly employees engaged in landscaping during each relevant year. Plaintiff and Class Members were paid hourly, with rates based on expertise and work type. They were required to arrive at the shop by 7am and work before their paid shift, and often were not paid for this time.

      "Plaintiff worked for Defendants in the maintenance/housekeeping and janitor/maintenance hourly-paid positions. Plaintiff worked at Defendants' location 7801 Alcoa Rd., Benton, AR 72019. Defendants classified Plaintiff and other hourly-paid employees as non-exempt and paid Plaintiff an hourly rate. Defendants' commonly applied practice was to pay Plaintiff and other hourly-paid employees for fewer than all of the hours they actually performed labor for Defendants. Plaintiff and other hourly-paid employees were required to work and subject to Defendants' policy or practice of regularly making deductions for purported meal breaks despite not actually taking bona fide meal breaks. Plaintiff and the others similarly situated employees had to perform off the clock work for Defendants while not clocked-in. Defendants required Plaintiff and other hourly-paid maintenance/housekeeping/janitor workers to continue working during their regularly scheduled lunch shift breaks. Plaintiff and other hourly-paid maintenance/housekeeping/janitor workers had to continue working up to thirty (30) minutes or more after their regularly scheduled shifts ended. Defendants did not permit Plaintiff and other hourly-paid workers to stay clocked-in after the scheduled end time of their shifts. Defendants' manager(s) edited time sheets to reflect Plaintiff and other similarly situated employees, took lunch breaks when, in fact, they had not, and to alter Plaintiff's end times to the financial advantage of Defendants. As a result of these policies, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and other hourly-paid employees a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and a proper overtime premium for all of the hours Plaintiff, etc., worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a week. Defendants failed to accurately record all of the time worked off-the-clock by Plaintiff and other hourly-paid workers and failed to properly compensate all of the off-the-clock hours. Defendants were aware of the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA. The FLSA Collective consists of all persons who were, are, or will be employed by Defendants as hourly-paid maintenance/janitor /housekeeping workers at any time within the applicable statute of limitations period. The members of the proposed Hourly FLSA Collective are similarly situated in that they share these traits: They were classified by Defendants as non-exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA; They were paid hourly rates; and They were subject to Defendants' common policy of requiring employees to work time for which they were not compensated. Defendants can readily identify the members of the Section 16(b) Collective,\n",

Plaintiff herself was sent at least two text messages without his express consent. Below is a depiction of actual text messages received by Plaintiff from Defendant: At no point in time did Plaintiff provide Defendant with his express consent to be contacted. Plaintiff is the subscriber and sole user of the ***-***-9685 phone number. The impersonal and generic nature of Defendant’s text messages, and the use of a short-code, demonstrates that Defendant utilized an ATDS in transmitting the messages. Plaintiff brings this case as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated. Plaintiff brings this case on behalf of a Class defined as follows: All persons within the United States who, within the four years prior to the filing of this Complaint, received text message made through the use of any automatic telephone dialing system, from Defendant or anyone on Defendant’s behalf, to said person’s cellular telephone number, not for emergency purpose and without the recipient’s prior express consent. Defendant – or third parties directed by Defendant– used equipment having the capacity to dial numbers without human intervention to make telephone calls to the cellular telephones of Plaintiff and the other members of the Class defined above. These calls were made without regard to whether Defendant had first obtained express consent to make such calls. Defendant knew that they did not have prior express consent to send these text messages.

The website includes purchasing plant seeds, pricing, shipping, ordering merchandise, and return and privacy policies. However, Defendant denies Plaintiff, a visually-impaired person, access to the website, and therefore, the goods and services offered. Plaintiff uses a JAWS screen-reader to access the Internet and has visited the website on separate occasions. While navigating the website, Plaintiff encountered multiple accessibility barriers, including lack of alternative text, empty links, redundant links, and linked images missing alt-text. Many pages on the website contain the same title elements, making it difficult for visually-impaired users to distinguish one page from another. The website also contains broken links, which is especially paralyzing for visually-impaired users. Due to the inaccessibility of the website, Plaintiff cannot fully and equally use or enjoy the goods and services offered by Defendant. The access barriers have caused a denial of Plaintiff's full and equal access in the past and deter Plaintiff from accessing the website on a regular basis. Plaintiff has actual knowledge of the access barriers that make these services inaccessible and independently unusable by blind and visually-impaired persons. Defendant has failed to take any prompt and equitable steps to remedy its discriminatory conduct. Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction requiring Defendant to make its website accessible to visually-impaired persons. Defendant must retain a qualified consultant to improve the accessibility of its website, work with the consultant to ensure all employees involved in website development are given web accessibility training, and perform automated accessibility audits and end-user testing on a periodic basis. Defendant must also incorporate all of the consultant's recommendations within sixty days of receiving them. Defendant must create a web accessibility policy and provide a notice, prominently and directly linked from the footer on each page of its website, soliciting feedback from visitors on how the accessibility of the website can be improved. Defendant must also provide a copy of the web accessibility policy to all web content personnel and train no fewer than three of its customer service operations call center agents to automatically escalate calls from users with disabilities. Defendant must modify its existing bug fix policies, practices, and procedures to include the elimination of bugs that cause the website to be inaccessible to users of screen reader technology. Defendant must also review its website on a periodic basis using both automated accessibility screening tools and end-user testing by visually-impaired persons.

Mr. Garcia is an experienced information technology (IT) professional with over a decade of experience in a wide range of technical applications and programming languages.  In and around September <DATE>, Bryant Vargas, a recruiter at Execu|Search, contacted Mr. Garcia about an open IT Trainer position at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and those similarly situated, hereby realleges and incorporates each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 54 with the same force as though separately alleged herein.  Under (3)(A), before taking an adverse employment action against a job applicant based on a consumer report, the employer must provide the applicant with a copy of their consumer report.

      "NYX's Website is heavily integrated with its physical stores, serving as a gateway to those brick and mortar locations. Through the Website, NYX customers are able to find information about the stores' locations and hours of operation, purchase makeup and makeup accessories, and learn about special offers and sales. NYX's policy and practice is to deny Plaintiff Young and other blind or visually-impaired users access to its Website, thereby denying the goods and services that are offered and integrated with NYX's stores. Plaintiff Young is a proficient JAWS screen-reader user and has visited the Website on separate occasions using the JAWS screen-reader. Due to the inaccessibility of its Website, blind and visually-impaired customers such as Plaintiff Young cannot fully and equally use or enjoy the facilities, goods, and services NYX offer to the public on its Website. NYX's Website is a service, privilege, or advantage of NYX's stores, and its inaccessibility denies blind patrons full and equal access to the facilities, goods, and services that NYX makes available to the non-disabled public. NYX has invested substantial sums in developing and maintaining its Website and has generated significant revenue from the Website, far greater than the associated cost of making its Website equally accessible to visually impaired customers. NYX discriminates against Plaintiff Young and other blind or visually-impaired users on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, and/or opportunities of NYX's Website and its physical locations. NYX's actions violate Title III of the ADA, N.Y. Exec. Law § 296, and N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107.  NYX's Website is a service that is integrated with its physical locations, and its inaccessibility denies blind patrons full and equal access to the facilities, goods, and services that NYX makes available to the non-disabled public. NYX has knowledge of the discrimination and has failed to take actions to correct these access barriers in the face of substantial harm and discrimination to blind class members. NYX discriminates, and will continue in the future to discriminate against Plaintiff and the New York City Subclass Members because of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, and/or opportunities of its Website and its establishments under\n",

      "The Class satisfies all the requirements of Rule 23 of the FRCP for maintaining a class action. The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable because there are hundreds and/or thousands of persons who have received debt collection letters and/or notices from the Defendant that violate specific provisions of the FDCPA. Plaintiff is complaining of a standard form letter and/or notice that is sent to hundreds of persons. There are questions of law and fact which are common to the Class and which predominate over questions affecting any individual Class member. Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the Class, which all arise from the same operative facts and are based on the same legal theories. Plaintiff has no interest adverse or antagonistic to the interest of the other members of the Class. Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the Class and has retained experienced and competent attorneys to represent the Class. A Class Action will permit large numbers of similarly situated persons to prosecute their common claims in a single forum simultaneously and without the duplication of effort and expense that numerous individual actions would engender. Defendant collects and attempts to collect debts incurred or alleged to have been incurred for personal, family or household purposes on behalf of creditors using the United States Postal Services, telephone and internet. Defendant caused to be delivered to the Plaintiff a collection letter in an attempt to collect the alleged debt. The letter was sent or caused to be sent by persons employed by Defendant as a “debt collector” as defined by the FDCPA. The letter stated in part; “Because of interest, late charges, and other charges that may vary from day to day, the amount due on the day you pay may be greater…..” Defendant could have taken the steps necessary to bring its actions within compliance with the FDCPA, but neglected to do so and failed to adequately review its actions to ensure compliance with the law. Defendant sent a written communication, in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A to at least 50 natural persons in the State of New York within one year of the date of this Complaint. Pursuant to the FDCPA, a debt collector is prohibited from using false, deceptive, or misleading representation in connection with the collection of a debt. The statement in Defendant’s letter is false, deceptive and misleading. Defendant failed to provide the consumer with the required written notice containing the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed, and a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty\n",

      "Plaintiff brings this claim on behalf of the following class, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(3). The Class consists of individuals with addresses in the State of New York to whom Defendant Simm sent an initial letter attempting to collect a consumer debt, where the current balance is listed as more than the charge-off balance. The identities of all class members are readily ascertainable from the records of Defendant and those companies and entities on whose behalf it attempts to collect and/or has purchased debts. The principal issue is whether the Defendant's written communication to consumers, in the forms attached as Exhibit A, violate 1692f and 1692g. The Plaintiff's claims are typical of the class members, as all are based upon the same facts and legal theories. The Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Plaintiff Class defined in this complaint. The Plaintiff has retained counsel with experience in handling consumer lawsuits, complex legal issues, and class actions. This action has been brought, and may properly be maintained, as a class action pursuant to the provisions of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because there is a well-defined community interest in the litigation. The Plaintiff allegedly incurred an obligation to non-party U.S. Bank, which arose out of transactions incurred primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, specifically a U.S. Bank personal loan. Defendant Simm collects and attempts to collect debts incurred or alleged to have been incurred for personal, family or household purposes on behalf of creditors using the United States Postal Services, telephone and internet. On or about <DATE>, Defendant Simm sent Plaintiff an initial collection letter regarding the alleged debt. The Letter states \"BALANCE: $11,554.12\" and then states: Plaintiff repeats the above allegations as if set forth here. Pursuant to , a debt collector may not use any deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. Pursuant to , a debt collector may not use any unfair or unconscionable means in connection with the collection of any debt. Plaintiff repeats the above allegations as if set forth here. Pursuant to 15 USC §1692g: Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the\n",

For example, employees that worked on the  Defendants\\u2019 landscaping related construction crews were paid at a higher hourly rate than  maintenance crews.       19.  Plaintiff was and Class Members are or were required to arrive at Defendants  shop by 7am to do work prior to beginning their paid shift.  Similarly, Plaintiff was and Class  Members are or were required to do work after their paid shift.    20.  Plaintiff were and Class Members are or were regularly not paid at all for their  work performed prior to leaving the shop in the morning or after arriving to the shop in the  afternoon.    21.  Plaintiff worked and Class Members worked or work routinely more than forty  hours per week and often were or are not paid for all of their overtime hours worked.     22.  When Plaintiff and Class Members were paid for their hours worked in excess of  forty in a workweek, they were often compensated in cash and at their regular hourly rate.    23.  At all times relevant to this action, the Defendants knowingly, willfully, or with  reckless disregard, carried out the illegal pattern or practice of failing to pay overtime wages due  to the Plaintiff and Class Members.   24.  At all times relevant to this action, the Defendants failed to maintain complete and  accurate records of the Plaintiff and Class Members\\u2019 hours of work and compensation as  required by the FLSA.   26.  The Plaintiff have fulfilled all prerequisites and/or requirements to bring this suit  and obtain the relief sought herein.  27.  Defendants employed other individuals (Class Members) to perform the same or  similar job duties as Plaintiff in that they worked performing landscaping or landscaping related  construction duties for the Defendants.   28.   Plaintiff was aware that the Defendants engaged in the same pattern and practice  of failing to properly compensate Class Members for all hours worked and failing to pay the  overtime compensation as required by the FLSA.   29.  Plaintiff and Class Members were and are subjected to the same pay provisions in  that they were not and are not paid for all the hours they worked or work, and were and are  regularly not paid the overtime rate (time-and-one-half regular hourly rate) for the hours they  worked or work in excess of forty hours per week.    30.  Defendants knowingly, willfully, or with reckless disregard carried out their  illegal pattern or practice of failing to pay overtime wages with respect to Plaintiff and Class  Members by failing to pay each employee for his/her total hours worked and/or by failing to pay  each employee at the proper overtime rate for work hours performed over forty hours in a  workweek.     32.  The Defendants\\u2019 failure to pay the overtime compensation at the rates required by  the FLSA results from generally applicable policies or practices and does not depend on the  personal circumstances of the Plaintiff or those joining this lawsuit. Rather, the same policy or  practice which resulted in the non-payment of overtime wages to Plaintiff applied to all Class  Members. Accordingly, the \\u201cClass Members\\u201d are properly defined as:   All workers who were subject to the work hours and payment practices detailed above and  who were consequently not paid properly in accordance with 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7207.   33.  All Class Members, regardless of their precise job requirements or rates of pay,  are entitled to overtime compensation for all hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.  Although the issue of damages may be individual in character, there is no detraction from the  common nucleus of liability facts.  35.  Under 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 216, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover  unpaid overtime compensation, as well as an equal amount as liquidated damages, as well as  attorney fees and costs.

This Cause of Action is brought on behalf of Plaintiffs and all members of the  class  286.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs and all members of the class in  violation of Section 296, subdivision 1(a) of the New York Executive Law, by subjecting them  to different treatment on the basis of their gender.  287.  Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs and members of the class by  treating them differently from and less preferably than similarly-situated employees of the male  dominated TED.  288.  As a result of Defendant\\u2019s conduct, Plaintiffs and the members of the class have  suffered and continue to suffer harm, including but not limited to lost earnings.

Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   26.  Plaintiff worked for Defendants in the maintenance/housekeeping and  janitor/maintenance hourly-paid positions that are standard in Defendants' 650 retail travel  centers and travel plazas.   27.  Plaintiff worked at Defendants' location 7801 Alcoa Rd., Benton, AR 72019.   28.  Throughout Plaintiff's employment, Defendants classified Plaintiff and other  hourly-paid employees as non-exempt and paid Plaintiff an hourly rate.   29.  It was Defendants' commonly applied practice to pay Plaintiff and other hourly- paid employees for fewer than all of the hours than the number of hours they actually performed  labor for Defendants.   30.  Specifically, Plaintiff and other hourly-paid employees were required to work and  subject to Defendants' policy or practice of regularly making deductions for purported meal breaks  despite Plaintiff and the others similarly situated employees not actually taking bona fide meal  breaks; and also Plaintiff and the other similarly situated employees had to perform off the clock  work for Defendants while not clocked-in.   32.  Defendants  required  Plaintiff  and  other  hourly-paid  maintenance/housekeeping/janitor workers to continue working during their regularly scheduled  lunch shift breaks.   33.  Further, Plaintiff and other hourly-paid maintenance/housekeeping/janitor  workers had to continue working up to thirty (30) minutes or more after their regularly scheduled  shifts ended.   34.  Defendants did not permit Plaintiff and other hourly-paid workers to stay clocked- in after the scheduled end time of their shifts.   35.  At times, Defendant's manager(s) edited time sheets to reflect Plaintiff and other  similarly situated employees, took lunch breaks when, in fact, they had not, and to alter Plaintiff's  end times to the financial advantage of Defendants.   36.  As a result of these policies, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and other hourly-paid  employees a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and a proper overtime premium for all of  the hours Plaintiff, etc., worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a week.   37.  At all relevant times herein, Defendants failed to accurately record all of the time  worked off-the-clock by Plaintiff and other hourly-paid workers and failed to properly compensate  all of the off-the-clock hours.   39.  At all times relevant hereto, Defendants was aware of the minimum wage and  overtime requirements of the FLSA.  V.  40.  Plaintiff brings his claims for relief for violation of the FLSA as a collective action  pursuant to Section 16(b) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 216(b).   41.  The FLSA Collective consists of all persons who were, are, or will be employed by  Defendants as hourly-paid maintenance/janitor /housekeeping workers at any time within the  applicable statute of limitations period.   42.  The relevant time period dates back three years from the date on which Plaintiff'  Class and Collective Action Complaint was filed herein and continues forward through the date of  judgment pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 255(a).   43.  The members of the proposed Hourly FLSA Collective are similarly situated in that  they share these traits:  a.  They were classified by Defendants as non-exempt from the minimum wage and  overtime requirements of the FLSA;  b.  They were paid hourly rates; and  c.  They were subject to Defendants' common policy of requiring employees to work  time for which they were not compensated.   45.  Defendants can readily identify the members of the Section 16(b) Collective, which  encompasses all hourly-paid plant workers within the past three years.   46.  The names and physical and mailing addresses of the FLSA collective action  Plaintiff are available from Defendants, and a Court-approved Notice should be provided to the  FLSA collective action Plaintiffs via first class mail and email to their last known physical and  electronic mailing addresses as soon as possible, together with other documents and information  descriptive of Plaintiff's FLSA claim.  B.  AMWA Rule 23 Classes   47.  Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated who were  employed by Defendants within the State of Arkansas, bring this claim for relief for violation of the  AM.WA as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   48.  Plaintiff proposes to represent all persons who were, are, or will be employed by  Defendants as similarly situated hourly-paid maintenance/janitor/housekeeping workers within  Arkansas at any time within the applicable statute of limitations period.   49.  Upon information and belief, Defendants employ or have employed within the  statutory period more than forty ( 40) hourly employees within Arkansas. Therefore, the proposed  Hourly AMW A Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.   60.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if  fully set forth in this section.   62.  During the relevant time period, Defendants unlawfully refrained from paying  Plaintiff a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and an overtime premium for hours over  forty per week.   63.  Defendants' failure to pay Plaintiff all overtime wages owed was willful.   64.  By reason of the unlawful acts alleged herein, Defendants are liable to Plaintiff for  monetary damages, liquidated damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, for all  violations that occurred within the three (3) years prior to the filing of this Complaint.  65.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   66.  Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, asserts this claim  for damages and declaratory relief pursuant to the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 201, et seq.   67.  At all relevant times, Defendants have and continue to be an \\\"employer\\\" of  Plaintiff and all those similarly situated within the meaning of the FLSA, 29 U .S.C. \\u00a7 203.   68.  Defendants classified Plaintiff and all similarly situated members of the Hourly  FLSA Collective as non-exempt from the overtime requirements of the FLSA.   69.  Despite the entitlement of Plaintiff and those similarly situated to minimum wage  and overtime payments under the FLSA, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and all those similarly  situated a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and an overtime rate of one and one-half  times their regular rates of pay for all hours worked over forty ( 40) in each one-week period.   71.  Like Plaintiff, these hourly-paid cleaning workers regularly worked more than forty  (40) hours in a week.   72.  Because these employees are similarly situated to Plaintiff, and are owed unpaid  wages and overtime for the same reasons, the opt-in class may be properly defined as:  All hourly-paid employees in the housekeeping/janitor and housekeeping/  maintenance positions within the past three years.   73.  Defendants willfully failed to pay overtime wages to Plaintiff and to others similarly  situated.   74.  By reason of the unlawful acts alleged herein, Defendants are liable to Plaintiff and  all those similarly situated for monetary damages, liquidated damages, and costs, including  reasonable attorneys' fees, for all violations that occurred within the three (3) years prior to the  filing of this Complaint.  75.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   76.  Plaintiff asserts this claim for damages and declaratory relief pursuant to the  AM.WA, Arkansas Code Annotated \\u00a7\\u00a7 11-4-201, et seq.   77.  At all relevant times, Defendants were Plaintiff's \\\"employer\\\" within the meaning  of the AM.WA, Ark. Code Ann.\\u00a7 11-4-203(4).   79.  Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and  an overtime premium for hours over forty per week, as required under the AMW A.   80.  Defendants' failure to pay Plaintiff a lawful minimum wage for all hours worked and  an overtime rate of pay for hours worked over forty ( 40) in a given week was in violation of the  84.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all previous paragraphs of this Complaint as though  fully incorporated in this section.   86.  At all relevant times, Defendants have been, and continues to be, an \\\"employer\\\"  of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed class within the meaning of the AMW A, Arkansas  Code Annotated\\u00a7 11-4-203(4).   87.  Defendants classified Plaintiff and all members of the AMW A Class as non-exempt  from the overtime requirements of the AMW A.   88.  Despite the entitlement of Plaintiff and the members of the proposed class to  minimum wage and overtime payments under the AMW A, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and  the members of the proposed class for all hours worked, including an overtime rate of one and one- half times their regular rates of pay for all hours worked over forty ( 40) in each one-week period.   89.  Plaintiff proposes to represent the AM.WA liability class of individuals defined as  follows:  All hourly-paid employees in the housekeeping/janitor and housekeeping/ maintenance  positions in Arkansas within the past three years.   90.

This misclassification was not due to any unique factor related to their employment or relationship with Defendants. As a result, exotic dancers were not paid minimum wages or overtime wages as required by law. The Trauth cases settled, and the Court ordered Spearmint Rhino to treat dancers as either employees or owners of the clubs. However, Defendants continued to require exotic dancers to pay fees for performing at Spearmint Rhino locations, contrary to the Court's order. Defendants use the same documents, policies, and procedures found to create an employer/employee relationship in other exotic dancer cases. Exotic dancers do not have any real decision-making authority, do not share equitably in the profitability of Spearmint Rhino, and do not have the right to control Spearmint Rhino management. They are economically dependent on Defendants and are paid no wages in connection with their work. Exotic dancers are required to report in and out at the beginning and end of every shift, and are subject to fines, penalties, or reprimands if they arrive late, leave early, or miss a shift. Defendants set the minimum tip amount that exotic dancers must collect from patrons, and exotic dancers are required to pay over to Defendants the portion they demand as their share, which bears no actual relation to expenses associated with rent and/or overhead. Exotic dancers are not permitted to hire or contract other qualified individuals to provide dances to patrons and increase the club's revenue. Plaintiff's investment in the exotic dancing business is minute when compared with that of Defendants. Plaintiff has made no capital investment in the facilities, advertising, maintenance, sound systems, lights, food, beverage, inventory, or staffing at Defendants' club. Defendants manage all aspects of the business operation, including attracting investors, establishing working hours and hours of operations, setting the atmosphere, coordinating advertising, hiring, selling a club's real and personal property, and controlling the staff. Exotic dancers are not responsible for any aspect of the enterprise's ongoing business risk. Defendants establish the minimum dance tip amounts that should be collected from patrons when dancing, and exotic dancers are not charged with the authority to accept a lower rate. The tips received by exotic dancers are not a return on a capital investment, but rather a gratuity for services rendered. Plaintiff worked exclusively for Defendants while employed as an exotic dancer at a Spearmint Rhino club, and was not employed for a set term, but rather anticipated that\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
